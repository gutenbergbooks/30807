(MRS. ADULFO SANCHEZ, OF MONTEREY)</p>


<p><i>At last, after so many years, I have the pleasure of re-introducing
you to &ldquo;Prince Otto,&rdquo; whom you will remember
a very little fellow, no bigger, in fact, than a few sheets of
memoranda written for me by your kind hand. The sight
of his name will carry you back to an old wooden house
embowered in creepers; a house that was far gone in the
respectable stages of antiquity, and seemed indissoluble
from the green garden in which it stood, and that yet was a
sea-traveller in its younger days, and had come round the
Horn piecemeal in the belly of a ship, and might have heard
the seamen stamping and shouting and the note of the boatswain&rsquo;s
whistle. It will recall to you the nondescript inhabitants,
now so widely scattered:&mdash;the two horses, the dog,
and the four cats, some of them still looking in your face
as you read these lines;&mdash;the poor lady, so unfortunately
married to an author;&mdash;the China boy, by this time, perhaps,
baiting his line by the banks of a river in the Flowery Land;&mdash;and
in particular the Scot who was then sick apparently
unto death, and whom you did so much to cheer and keep
in good behaviour.</i></p>

<p><i>You may remember that he was full of ambitions and
designs: so soon as he had his health again completely, you
may remember the fortune he was to earn, the journeys he
was to go upon, the delights he was to enjoy and confer, and
(among other matters) the masterpiece he was to make of
&ldquo;Prince Otto&ldquo;!</i></p>

<p><i>Well, we will not give in that we are finally beaten. We</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4"></a>4</span>
<i>read together in those days the story of Braddock, and how,
as he was carried dying from the scene of his defeat, he
promised himself to do better another time: a story that
will always touch a brave heart, and a dying speech worthy
of a more fortunate commander. I try to be of Braddock&rsquo;s
mind. I still mean to get my health again; I still purpose,
by hook or crook, this book or the next, to launch a masterpiece;
and I still intend&mdash;somehow, some time or other&mdash;to
see your face and to hold your hand.</i></p>

<p><i>Meanwhile, this little paper traveller goes forth instead,
crosses the great seas and the long plains and the dark mountains,
and comes at last to your door in Monterey, charged
with tender greetings. Pray you, take him in. He comes
from a house where (even as in your own) there are gathered
together some of the waifs of our company at Oakland; a
house&mdash;for all its outlandish Gaelic name and distant station&mdash;where
you are well-beloved.</i></p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH THE PRINCE DEPARTS ON AN
ADVENTURE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">You</span> shall seek in vain upon the map of Europe for the
bygone state of Gr√ºnewald. An independent principality,
an infinitesimal member of the German Empire, she
played, for several centuries, her part in the discord of
Europe; and, at last, in the ripeness of time and at the
spiriting of several bald diplomatists, vanished like a
morning ghost. Less fortunate than Poland, she left not
a regret behind her; and the very memory of her boundaries
has faded.</p>

<p>It was a patch of hilly country covered with thick
wood. Many streams took their beginning in the glens
of Gr√ºnewald, turning mills for the inhabitants. There
was one town, Mittwalden, and many brown, wooden
hamlets, climbing roof above roof, along the steep bottom
of dells, and communicating by covered bridges over the
larger of the torrents. The hum of watermills, the splash
of running water, the clean odour of pine sawdust, the
sound and smell of the pleasant wind among the innumerable
army of the mountain pines, the dropping fire of
huntsmen, the dull stroke of the wood-axe, intolerable
roads, fresh trout for supper in the clean bare chamber of
an inn, and the song of birds and the music of the village-bells&mdash;these
were the recollections of the Gr√ºnewald tourist.</p>

<p>North and east the foothills of Gr√ºnewald sank with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8"></a>8</span>
varying profile into a vast plain. On these sides many
small states bordered with the principality, Gerolstein,
an extinct grand duchy, among the number. On the
south it marched with the comparatively powerful kingdom
of Seaboard Bohemia, celebrated for its flowers and
mountain bears, and inhabited by a people of singular
simplicity and tenderness of heart. Several intermarriages
had, in the course of centuries, united the crowned
families of Gr√ºnewald and Maritime Bohemia; and the
last Prince of Gr√ºnewald, whose history I purpose to
relate, drew his descent through Perdita, the only daughter
of King Florizel the First of Bohemia. That these intermarriages
had in some degree mitigated the rough, manly
stock of the first Gr√ºnewalds, was an opinion widely held
within the borders of the principality. The charcoal
burner, the mountain sawyer, the wielder of the broad
axe among the congregated pines of Gr√ºnewald, proud of
their hard hands, proud of their shrewd ignorance and
almost savage lore, looked with an unfeigned contempt
on the soft character and manners of the sovereign
race.</p>

<p>The precise year of grace in which this tale begins
shall be left to the conjecture of the reader. But for the
season of the year (which, in such a story, is the more
important of the two) it was already so far forward in
the spring, that when mountain people heard horns echoing
all day about the north-west corner of the principality,
they told themselves that Prince Otto and his
hunt were up and out for the last time till the return of
autumn.</p>

<p>At this point the borders of Gr√ºnewald descend somewhat
steeply, here and there breaking into crags; and
this shaggy and trackless country stands in a bold contrast
to the cultivated plain below. It was traversed at
that period by two roads alone; one, the imperial highway,
bound to Brandenau in Gerolstein, descended the
slope obliquely and by the easiest gradients. The other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9"></a>9</span>
ran like a fillet across the very forehead of the hills, dipping
into savage gorges, and wetted by the spray of tiny waterfalls.
Once it passed beside a certain tower or castle,
built sheer upon the margin of a formidable cliff, and
commanding a vast prospect of the skirts of Gr√ºnewald
and the busy plains of Gerolstein. The Felsenburg (so
this tower was called) served now as a prison, now as a
hunting-seat; and for all it stood so lonesome to the
naked eye, with the aid of a good glass the burghers of
Brandenau could count its windows from the lime-tree
terrace where they walked at night.</p>

<p>In the wedge of forest hillside enclosed between the
roads, the horns continued all day long to scatter tumult;
and at length, as the sun began to draw near to the horizon
of the plain, a rousing triumph announced the slaughter
of the quarry. The first and second huntsman had drawn
somewhat aside, and from the summit of a knoll gazed
down before them on the drooping shoulders of the hill
and across the expanse of plain. They covered their eyes,
for the sun was in their faces. The glory of its going down
was somewhat pale. Through the confused tracery of
many thousands of naked poplars, the smoke of so many
houses, and the evening steam ascending from the fields,
the sails of a windmill on a gentle eminence moved very
conspicuously, like a donkey&rsquo;s ears. And hard by, like
an open gash, the imperial high-road ran straight sunward,
an artery of travel.</p>

<p>There is one of nature&rsquo;s spiritual ditties, that has not
yet been set to words or human music: &ldquo;The Invitation
to the Road&ldquo;; an air continually sounding in the ears
of gipsies, and to whose inspiration our nomadic fathers
journeyed all their days. The hour, the season, and the
scene, all were in delicate accordance. The air was full
of birds of passage, steering westward and northward over
Gr√ºnewald, an army of specks to the up-looking eye.
And below, the great practicable road was bound for the
same quarter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page10"></a>10</span></p>

<p>But to the two horsemen on the knoll this spiritual
ditty was unheard. They were, indeed, in some concern
of mind, scanning every fold of the subjacent forest, and
betraying both anger and dismay in their impatient
gestures.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not see him, Kuno,&rdquo; said the first huntsman,
&ldquo;nowhere&mdash;not a trace, not a hair of the mare&rsquo;s tail!
No, sir, he&rsquo;s off; broke cover and got away. Why, for
twopence I would hunt him with the dogs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mayhap, he&rsquo;s gone home,&rdquo; said Kuno, but without
conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo; sneered the other. &ldquo;I give him twelve
days to get home. No, it&rsquo;s begun again; it&rsquo;s as it was
three years ago, before he married; a disgrace! Hereditary
prince, hereditary fool! There goes the government
over the borders on a grey mare. What&rsquo;s that? No,
nothing&mdash;no, I tell you, on my word, I set more store
by a good gelding or an English dog. That for your
Otto!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not my Otto,&rdquo; growled Kuno.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I don&rsquo;t know whose he is,&rdquo; was the retort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would put your hand in the fire for him to-morrow,&rdquo;
said Kuno, facing round.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried the huntsman. &ldquo;I would see him
hanged! I&rsquo;m a Gr√ºnewald patriot&mdash;enrolled, and have
my medal, too; and I would help a prince! I&rsquo;m for
liberty and Gondremark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s all one,&rdquo; said Kuno. &ldquo;If anybody said
what you said, you would have his blood, and you
know it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have him on the brain,&rdquo; retorted his companion.&mdash;&ldquo;There
he goes!&rdquo; he cried, the next
moment.</p>

<p>And sure enough, about a mile down the mountain,
a rider on a white horse was seen to flit rapidly across a
heathy open and vanish among the trees on the farther
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page11"></a>11</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In ten minutes he&rsquo;ll be over the border into Gerolstein,&rdquo;
said Kuno. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s past cure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if he founders that mare, I&rsquo;ll never forgive
him,&rdquo; added the other, gathering his reins.</p>

<p>And as they turned down from the knoll to rejoin
their comrades, the sun dipped and disappeared, and the
woods fell instantly into the gravity and greyness of the
early night.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH THE PRINCE PLAYS HAROUN-AL-RASCHID</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> night fell upon the Prince while he was threading
green tracks in the lower valleys of the wood; and though
the stars came out overhead and displayed the interminable
order of the pine-tree pyramids, regular and dark
like cypresses, their light was of small service to a traveller
in such lonely paths, and from thenceforth he rode at
random. The austere face of nature, the uncertain issue
of his course, the open sky and the free air, delighted him
like wine; and the hoarse chafing of a river on his left
sounded in his ears agreeably.</p>

<p>It was past eight at night before his toil was rewarded
and he issued at last out of the forest on the firm white
high-road. It lay downhill before him with a sweeping
eastward trend, faintly bright between the thickets; and
Otto paused and gazed upon it. So it ran, league after
league, still joining others, to the farthest ends of Europe,
there skirting the sea-surge, here gleaming in the lights
of cities; and the innumerable army of tramps and travellers
moved upon it in all lands as by a common impulse,
and were now in all places drawing near to the inn door
and the night&rsquo;s rest. The pictures swarmed and vanished
in his brain; a surge of temptation, a beat of all his
blood, went over him, to set spur to the mare and to go
on into the unknown for ever. And then it passed away;
hunger and fatigue, and that habit of middling actions
which we call common sense, resumed their empire; and
in that changed mood his eye lighted upon two bright
windows on his left hand, between the road and river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page13"></a>13</span></p>

<p>He turned off by a by-road, and in a few minutes he
was knocking with his whip on the door of a large farmhouse,
and a chorus of dogs from the farmyard were
making angry answer. A very tall, old, white-headed
man came, shading a candle, at the summons. He had
been of great strength in his time, and of a handsome
countenance; but now he was fallen away, his teeth were
quite gone, and his voice when he spoke was broken and
falsetto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will pardon me,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;I am a traveller
and have entirely lost my way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the old man, in a very stately, shaky
manner, &ldquo;you are at the River Farm, and I am Killian
Gottesheim, at your disposal. We are here, sir, at about
an equal distance from Mittwalden in Gr√ºnewald and
Brandenau in Gerolstein: six leagues to either, and the
road excellent; but there is not a wine-bush, not a
carter&rsquo;s alehouse, anywhere between. You will have to
accept my hospitality for the night; rough hospitality,
to which I make you freely welcome; for, sir,&rdquo; he added,
with a bow, &ldquo;it is God who sends the guest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen. And I most heartily thank you,&rdquo; replied
Otto, bowing in his turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fritz,&rdquo; said the old man, turning towards the interior,
&ldquo;lead round this gentleman&rsquo;s horse; and you, sir, condescend
to enter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto entered a chamber occupying the greater part
of the ground-floor of the building. It had probably once
been divided; for the farther end was raised by a long
step above the nearer, and the blazing fire and the white
supper-table seemed to stand upon a da√Øs. All around
were dark, brass-mounted cabinets and cupboards; dark
shelves carrying ancient country crockery; guns and
antlers and broadside ballads on the wall; a tall old
clock with roses on the dial; and down in one corner
the comfortable promise of a wine-barrel. It was homely,
elegant, and quaint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page14"></a>14</span></p>

<p>A powerful youth hurried out to attend on the grey
mare; and when Mr. Killian Gottesheim had presented
him to his daughter Ottilia, Otto followed to the stable
as became, not perhaps the Prince, but the good horseman.
When he returned, a smoking omelette and some
slices of home-cured ham were waiting him; these were
followed by a ragout and a cheese; and it was not until
his guest had entirely satisfied his hunger, and the whole
party drew about the fire over the wine-jug, that Killian
Gottesheim&rsquo;s elaborate courtesy permitted him to address
a question to the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have perhaps ridden far, sir?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have, as you say, ridden far,&rdquo; replied Otto; &ldquo;and,
as you have seen, I was prepared to do justice to your
daughter&rsquo;s cookery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly, sir, from the direction of Brandenau?&rdquo;
continued Killian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely: and I should have slept to-night, had I
not wandered, in Mittwalden,&rdquo; answered the Prince,
weaving in a patch of truth, according to the habit of
all liars.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Business leads you to Mittwalden?&rdquo; was the next
question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mere curiosity,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;I have never yet
visited the principality of Gr√ºnewald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pleasant state, sir,&rdquo; piped the old man, nodding,
&ldquo;a very pleasant state, and a fine race, both pines and
people. We reckon ourselves part Gr√ºnewalders here,
lying so near the borders; and the river there is all good
Gr√ºnewald water, every drop of it. Yes, sir, a fine state.
A man of Gr√ºnewald now will swing me an axe over his
head that many a man of Gerolstein could hardly lift;
and the pines, why, deary me, there must be more pines
in that little state, sir, than people in this whole big world.
&rsquo;Tis twenty years now since I crossed the marshes, for
we grow home-keepers in old age; but I mind it as if
it was yesterday. Up and down, the road keeps right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15"></a>15</span>
on from here to Mittwalden; and nothing all the way but
the good green pine-trees, big and little, and water-power!
water-power at every step, sir. We once sold a bit of
forest, up there beside the high-road; and the sight of
minted money that we got for it has set me ciphering
ever since what all the pines in Gr√ºnewald would amount
to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose you see nothing of the Prince?&rdquo; inquired
Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the young man, speaking for the first
time, &ldquo;nor want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why so? is he so much disliked?&rdquo; asked Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not what you might call disliked,&rdquo; replied the old
gentleman, &ldquo;but despised, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the Prince, somewhat faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, despised,&rdquo; nodded Killian, filling a long pipe,
&ldquo;and, to my way of thinking, justly despised. Here is
a man with great opportunities, and what does he do
with them? He hunts, and he dresses very prettily&mdash;which
is a thing to be ashamed of in a man&mdash;and he acts
plays; and if he does aught else, the news of it has not
come here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yet these are all innocent,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;What
would you have him do&mdash;make war?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the old man. &ldquo;But here it is: I
have been fifty years upon this River Farm, and wrought
in it, day in, day out; I have ploughed and sowed and
reaped, and risen early, and waked late; and this is the
upshot: that all these years it has supported me and my
family; and been the best friend that ever I had, set
aside my wife; and now, when my time comes, I leave
it a better farm than when I found it. So it is, if a man
works hearty in the order of nature, he gets bread and he
receives comfort, and whatever he touches breeds. And
it humbly appears to me, if that Prince was to labour
on his throne, as I have laboured and wrought in my
farm, he would find both an increase and a blessing.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page16"></a>16</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe with you, sir,&rdquo; Otto said; &ldquo;and yet the
parallel is inexact. For the farmer&rsquo;s life is natural and
simple; but the prince&rsquo;s is both artificial and complicated.
It is easy to do right in the one, and exceedingly
difficult not to do wrong in the other. If your crop is
blighted, you can take off your bonnet and say, &lsquo;God&rsquo;s
will be done&rsquo;; but if the prince meets with a reverse, he
may have to blame himself for the attempt. And, perhaps,
if all the kings in Europe were to confine themselves
to innocent amusement, the subjects would be the
better off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the young man Fritz, &ldquo;you are in the
right of it there. That was a true word spoken. And
I see you are like me, a good patriot and an enemy to
princes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto was somewhat abashed at this deduction, and
he made haste to change his ground. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you surprise me by what you say of this Prince Otto.
I have heard him, I must own, more favourably painted.
I was told he was, in his heart, a good fellow, and the
enemy of no one but himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so he is, sir,&rdquo; said the girl, &ldquo;a very handsome,
pleasant prince; and we know some who would shed their
blood for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! Kuno!&rdquo; said Fritz. &ldquo;An ignoramus!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, Kuno, to be sure,&rdquo; quavered the old farmer.
&ldquo;Well, since this gentleman is a stranger to these parts,
and curious about the Prince, I do believe that story
might divert him. This Kuno, you must know, sir, is one
of the hunt servants, and a most ignorant, intemperate
man: a right Gr√ºnewalder, as we say in Gerolstein. We
know him well, in this house; for he has come as far as
here after his stray dogs; and I make all welcome, sir,
without account of state or nation. And, indeed, between
Gerolstein and Gr√ºnewald the peace has held so long that
the roads stand open like my door; and a man will make
no more of the frontier than the very birds themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"></a>17</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;it has been a long peace&mdash;a peace
of centuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Centuries, as you say,&rdquo; returned Killian: &ldquo;the more
the pity that it should not be for ever. Well, sir, this
Kuno was one day in fault, and Otto, who has a quick
temper, up with his whip and thrashed him, they do say,
soundly. Kuno took it as best he could, but at last he
broke out, and dared the Prince to throw his whip away
and wrestle like a man; for we are all great at wrestling
in these parts, and it&rsquo;s so that we generally settle our
disputes. Well, sir, the Prince did so; and, being a
weakly creature, found the tables turned; for the man
whom he had just been thrashing like a negro slave,
lifted him with a back grip and threw him heels overhead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He broke his bridle-arm,&rdquo; cried Fritz&mdash;&ldquo;and some
say his nose. Serve him right, say I! Man to man,
which is the better at that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo; asked Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, then Kuno carried him home; and they were
the best of friends from that day forth. I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s
a discreditable story, you observe,&rdquo; continued Mr. Gottesheim;
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s droll, and that&rsquo;s the fact. A man should
think before he strikes; for, as my nephew says, man
to man was the old valuation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, if you were to ask me,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;I should
perhaps surprise you. I think it was the Prince that
conquered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, sir, you would be right,&rdquo; replied Killian seriously.
&ldquo;In the eyes of God, I do not question but you
would be right; but men, sir, look at these things differently,
and they laugh.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They made a song of it,&rdquo; observed Fritz. &ldquo;How
does it go? Ta-tum-ta-ra....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; interrupted Otto, who had no great anxiety
to hear the song, &ldquo;the Prince is young; he may yet
mend.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18"></a>18</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so young, by your leave,&rdquo; cried Fritz. &ldquo;A man
of forty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thirty-six,&rdquo; corrected Mr. Gottesheim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; cried Ottilia, in obvious disillusion, &ldquo;a man of
middle age! And they said he was so handsome when
he was young!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And bald, too,&rdquo; added Fritz.</p>

<p>Otto passed his hand among his locks. At that moment
he was far from happy, and even the tedious evenings
at Mittwalden Palace began to smile upon him by comparison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, six-and-thirty!&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;A man is not
yet old at six-and-thirty. I am that age myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should have taken you for more, sir,&rdquo; piped the old
farmer. &ldquo;But if that be so, you are of an age with
Master Ottekin, as people call him; and, I would wager
a crown, have done more service in your time. Though
it seems young by comparison with men of a great age
like me, yet it&rsquo;s some way through life for all that; and
the mere fools and fiddlers are beginning to grow weary
and to look old. Yes, sir, by six-and-thirty, if a man be
a follower of God&rsquo;s laws, he should have made himself a
home and a good name to live by; he should have got a
wife and a blessing on his marriage; and his works, as
the Word says, should begin to follow him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, the Prince is married,&rdquo; cried Fritz, with
a coarse burst of laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That seems to entertain you, sir,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said the young boor. &ldquo;Did you not know
that? I thought all Europe knew it!&rdquo; And he added
a pantomime of a nature to explain his accusation to
the dullest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Gottesheim, &ldquo;it is very plain that
you are not from hereabouts! But the truth is, that
the whole princely family and Court are rips and rascals,
not one to mend another. They live, sir, in idleness and&mdash;what
most commonly follows it&mdash;corruption. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19"></a>19</span>
Princess has a lover; a Baron, as he calls himself, from
East Prussia; and the Prince is so little of a man, sir,
that he holds the candle. Nor is that the worst of it, for
this foreigner and his paramour are suffered to transact
the state affairs, while the Prince takes the salary and
leaves all things to go to wrack. There will follow upon
this some manifest judgment which, though I am old, I
may survive to see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good man, you are in the wrong about Gondremark,&rdquo;
said Fritz, showing a greatly increased animation;
&ldquo;but for all the rest, you speak the God&rsquo;s truth like a
good patriot. As for the Prince, if he would take and
strangle his wife, I would forgive him yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Fritz,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;that would be to
add iniquity to evil. For you perceive, sir,&rdquo; he continued,
once more addressing himself to the unfortunate Prince,
&ldquo;this Otto has himself to thank for these disorders. He
has his young wife, and his principality, and he has sworn
to cherish both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sworn at the altar!&rdquo; echoed Fritz. &ldquo;But put your
faith in princes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, he leaves them both to an adventurer
from East Prussia,&rdquo; pursued the farmer: &ldquo;leaves the
girl to be seduced and to go on from bad to worse, till
her name&rsquo;s become a tap-room by-word, and she not yet
twenty; leaves the country to be overtaxed, and bullied
with armaments, and jockied into war&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;War!&rdquo; cried Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So they say, sir; those that watch their ongoings,
say to war,&rdquo; asseverated Killian. &ldquo;Well, sir, that is
very sad; it is a sad thing for this poor, wicked girl to
go down to hell with people&rsquo;s curses; it&rsquo;s a sad thing
for a tight little happy country to be misconducted; but
whoever may complain, I humbly conceive, sir, that this
Otto cannot. What he has worked for, that he has got;
and may God have pity on his soul, for a great and a silly
sinner&rsquo;s!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page20"></a>20</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He has broke his oath; then he is a perjurer. He
takes the money and leaves the work; why, then plainly
he&rsquo;s a thief. A cuckold he was before, and a fool by
birth. Better me that!&rdquo; cried Fritz, and snapped his
fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, sir, you will see a little,&rdquo; continued the
farmer, &ldquo;why we think so poorly of this Prince Otto.
There&rsquo;s such a thing as a man being pious and honest in
the private way; and there is such a thing, sir, as a public
virtue; but when a man has neither, the Lord lighten
him! Even this Gondremark, that Fritz here thinks
so much of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; interrupted Fritz, &ldquo;Gondremark&rsquo;s the man
for me. I would we had his like in Gerolstein.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a bad man,&rdquo; said the old farmer, shaking his
head; &ldquo;and there was never good begun by the breach
of God&rsquo;s commandments. But so far I will go with you:
he is a man that works for what he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;s the hope of Gr√ºnewald,&rdquo; cried Fritz.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t suit some of your high-and-dry, old, ancient
ideas; but he&rsquo;s a downright modern man&mdash;a man of the
new lights and the progress of the age. He does some
things wrong; so they all do; but he has the people&rsquo;s
interests next his heart; and you mark me&mdash;you, sir,
who are a Liberal, and the enemy of all their governments,
you please to mark my words&mdash;the day will come
in Gr√ºnewald, when they take out that yellow-headed
skulk of a Prince and that dough-faced Messalina of a
Princess, march &rsquo;em back foremost over the borders, and
proclaim the Baron Gondremark first President. I&rsquo;ve
heard them say it in a speech. I was at a meeting once
at Brandenau, and the Mittwalden delegates spoke up
for fifteen thousand. Fifteen thousand, all brigaded, and
each man with a medal round his neck to rally by. That&rsquo;s
all Gondremark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, sir, you see what it leads to: wild talk to-day,
and wilder doings to-morrow,&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21"></a>21</span>
there is one thing certain: that this Gondremark has
one foot in the Court backstairs, and the other in the
Masons&rsquo; lodges. He gives himself out, sir, for what
nowadays they call a patriot: a man from East
Prussia!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give himself out!&rdquo; cried Fritz. &ldquo;He is! He is
to lay by his title as soon as the Republic is declared;
I heard it in a speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lay by Baron to take up President?&rdquo; returned
Killian. &ldquo;King Log, King Stork. But you&rsquo;ll live longer
than I, and you will see the fruits of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; whispered Ottilia, pulling at the speaker&rsquo;s
coat, &ldquo;surely the gentleman is ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; cried the farmer, re-waking to
hospitable thoughts; &ldquo;can I offer you anything?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you. I am very weary,&rdquo; answered Otto.
&ldquo;I have presumed upon my strength. If you would show
me to a bed, I should be grateful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ottilia, a candle!&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Indeed
sir, you look paley. A little cordial water? No? Then
follow me, I beseech you, and I will bring you to the
stranger&rsquo;s bed. You are not the first by many who has
slept well below my roof,&rdquo; continued the old gentleman,
mounting the stairs before his guest; &ldquo;for good food,
honest wine, a grateful conscience, and a little pleasant
chat before a man retires, are worth all the possets and
apothecary&rsquo;s drugs. See, sir,&rdquo; and here he opened a door
and ushered Otto into a little whitewashed sleeping-room,
&ldquo;here you are in port. It is small, but it is airy, and
the sheets are clean and kept in lavender. The window,
too, looks out above the river, and there&rsquo;s no music like a
little river&rsquo;s. It plays the same tune (and that&rsquo;s the
favourite) over and over again, and yet does not weary of
it like men fiddlers. It takes the mind out of doors; and
though we should be grateful for good houses, there is,
after all, no house like God&rsquo;s out-of-doors. And lastly,
sir, it quiets a man down like saying his prayers. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22"></a>22</span>
here, sir, I take my kind leave of you until to-morrow;
and it is my prayerful wish that you may slumber like a
prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the old man, with the twentieth courteous inclination,
left his guest alone.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH THE PRINCE COMFORTS AGE AND BEAUTY
AND DELIVERS A LECTURE ON
DISCRETION IN LOVE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Prince was early abroad: in the time of the first
chorus of birds, of the pure and quiet air, of the slanting
sunlight and the mile-long shadows. To one who had
passed a miserable night, the freshness of that hour was
tonic and reviving; to steal a march upon his slumbering
fellows, to be the Adam of the coming day, composed
and fortified his spirits; and the Prince, breathing deep
and pausing as he went, walked in the wet fields beside
his shadow, and was glad.</p>

<p>A trellised path led down into the valley of the brook,
and he turned to follow it. The stream was a break-neck,
bolling highland river. Hard by the farm, it leaped a
little precipice in a thick grey-mare&rsquo;s tail of twisted filaments,
and then lay and worked and bubbled in a lynn.
Into the middle of this quaking pool a rock protruded,
shelving to a cape; and thither Otto scrambled and sat
down to ponder.</p>

<p>Soon the sun struck through the screen of branches
and thin early leaves that made a hanging bower above
the fall; and the golden lights and flitting shadows fell
upon and marbled the surface of that seething pot; and
rays plunged deep among the turning waters; and a
spark, as bright as a diamond, lit upon the swaying eddy.
It began to grow warm where Otto lingered, warm and
heady; the lights swam, weaving their maze across the
shaken pool; on the impending rock, reflections danced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page"></a></span>24
like butterflies; and the air was fanned by the waterfall
as by a swinging curtain.</p>

<p>Otto, who was weary with tossing and beset with horrid
phantoms of remorse and jealousy, instantly fell dead
in love with that sun-chequered, echoing corner. Holding
his feet, he stared out of a drowsy trance, wondering,
admiring, musing, losing his way among uncertain thoughts.
There is nothing that so apes the external bearing of free
will as that unconscious bustle, obscurely following liquid
laws, with which a river contends among obstructions. It
seems the very play of man and destiny, and as Otto pored
on these recurrent changes, he grew, by equal steps, the
sleepier and the more profound. Eddy and Prince were
alike jostled in their purpose, alike anchored by intangible
influences in one corner of the world. Eddy and Prince
were alike useless, starkly useless, in the cosmology of
men. Eddy and Prince&mdash;Prince and Eddy.</p>

<p>It is probable he had been some while asleep when a
voice recalled him from oblivion. &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; it was saying;
and looking round, he saw Mr. Killian&rsquo;s daughter, terrified
by her boldness, and making bashful signals from the
shore. She was a plain, honest lass, healthy and happy
and good, and with that sort of beauty that comes of
happiness and health. But her confusion lent her for the
moment an additional charm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said Otto, rising and moving towards
her. &ldquo;I arose early and was in a dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, sir!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I wish to beg of you to spare
my father; for I assure your Highness, if he had known
who you was, he would have bitten his tongue out sooner.
And Fritz, too&mdash;how he went on! But I had a notion;
and this morning I went straight down into the stable,
and there was your Highness&rsquo;s crown upon the stirrup-irons!
But, O, sir, I made certain you would spare
them; for they were as innocent as lambs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Otto, both amused and gratified,
&ldquo;you do not understand. It is I who am in the wrong;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25"></a>25</span>
for I had no business to conceal my name and lead on
these gentlemen to speak of me. And it is I who have to
beg of you that you will keep my secret and not betray
the discourtesy of which I was guilty. As for any fear
of me, your friends are safe in Gerolstein; and even in
my own territory, you must be well aware I have no
power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, sir,&rdquo; she said, curtseying, &ldquo;I would not say that:
the huntsmen would all die for you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy Prince!&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;But although you are
too courteous to avow the knowledge, you have had many
opportunities of learning that I am a vain show. Only
last night we heard it very clearly stated. You see the
shadow flitting on this hard rock? Prince Otto, I am
afraid, is but the moving shadow, and the name of the
rock is Gondremark. Ah! if your friends had fallen
foul of Gondremark! But happily the younger of the
two admires him. But as for the old gentleman your
father, he is a wise man and an excellent talker, and I
would take a long wager he is honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, for honest, your Highness, that he is!&rdquo; exclaimed
the girl. &ldquo;And Fritz is as honest as he. And as for
all they said, it was just talk and nonsense. When
countryfolk get gossiping, they go on, I do assure you,
for the fun; they don&rsquo;t as much as think of what they
say. If you went to the next farm, it&rsquo;s my belief you
would hear as much against my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;there you go too fast. For
all that was said against Prince Otto&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it was shameful!&rdquo; cried the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not shameful&mdash;true,&rdquo; returned Otto. &ldquo;O, yes&mdash;true.
I am all they said of me&mdash;all that and worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never!&rdquo; cried Ottilia. &ldquo;Is that how you do?
Well, you would never be a soldier. Now, if anyone
accuses me, I get up and give it them. O, I defend myself.
I wouldn&rsquo;t take a fault at another person&rsquo;s hands,
no, not if I had it on my forehead. And that&rsquo;s what you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26"></a>26</span>
must do, if you mean to live it out. But, indeed, I never
heard such nonsense. I should think you was ashamed of
yourself! You&rsquo;re bald, then, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Otto, fairly laughing. &ldquo;There I acquit
myself: not bald!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and good?&rdquo; pursued the girl. &ldquo;Come now,
you know you are good, and I&rsquo;ll make you say so....
Your Highness, I beg your humble pardon. But there&rsquo;s
no disrespect intended. And anyhow, you know you
are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, now, what am I to say?&rdquo; replied Otto. &ldquo;You
are a cook, and excellently well you do it; I embrace the
chance of thanking you for the ragout. Well now, have
you not seen good food so bedevilled by unskilful cookery
that no one could be brought to eat the pudding? That
is me, my dear. I am full of good ingredients, but the
dish is worthless. I am&mdash;I give it you in one word&mdash;sugar
in the salad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t care, you&rsquo;re good,&rdquo; reiterated Ottilia,
a little flushed by having failed to understand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you one thing,&rdquo; replied Otto: &ldquo;You are!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, that&rsquo;s what they all said of you,&rdquo; moralised
the girl; &ldquo;such a tongue to come round&mdash;such a flattering
tongue!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you forget, I am a man of middle age,&rdquo; the
Prince chuckled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, to speak to you, I should think you was a
boy; and Prince or no Prince, if you came worrying
where I was cooking, I would pin a napkin to your tails....
And, O Lord, I declare I hope your Highness will
forgive me,&rdquo; the girl added. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t keep it in my
mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more can I,&rdquo; cried Otto. &ldquo;That is just what
they complain of!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They made a loverly-looking couple; only the heavy
pouring of that horse-tail of water made them raise their
voices above lovers&rsquo; pitch. But to a jealous onlooker
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27"></a>27</span>
from above, their mirth and close proximity might easily
give umbrage; and a rough voice out of a tuft of
brambles began calling on Ottilia by name. She changed
colour at that. &ldquo;It is Fritz,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go, my dear, and I need not bid you go in peace,
for I think you have discovered that I am not formidable
at close quarters,&rdquo; said the Prince, and made her a fine
gesture of dismissal.</p>

<p>So Ottilia skipped up the bank, and disappeared into
the thicket, stopping once for a single blushing bob&mdash;blushing,
because she had in the interval once more forgotten
and remembered the stranger&rsquo;s quality.</p>

<p>Otto returned to his rock promontory; but his humour
had in the meantime changed. The sun now shone more
fairly on the pool; and over its brown, welling surface,
the blue of heaven and the golden green of the spring
foliage danced in fleeting arabesque. The eddies laughed
and brightened with essential colour. And the beauty
of the dell began to rankle in the Prince&rsquo;s mind; it was
so near to his own borders, yet without. He had never
had much of the joy of possessorship in any of the thousand
and one beautiful and curious things that were his;
and now he was conscious of envy for what was another&rsquo;s.
It was, indeed, a smiling, dilettante sort of envy; but
yet there it was: the passion of Ahab for the vineyard,
done in little; and he was relieved when Mr. Killian
appeared upon the scene.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, sir, that you have slept well under my plain
roof,&rdquo; said the old farmer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am admiring this sweet spot that you are privileged
to dwell in,&rdquo; replied Otto, evading the inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is rustic,&rdquo; returned Mr. Gottesheim, looking
around him with complacency, &ldquo;a very rustic corner;
and some of the land to the west is most excellent fat
land, excellent deep soil. You should see my wheat in
the ten-acre field. There is not a farm in Gr√ºnewald,
no, nor many in Gerolstein, to match the River Farm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28"></a>28</span>
Some sixty&mdash;I keep thinking when I sow&mdash;some sixty,
and some seventy, and some an hundredfold; and my
own place, six score! But that, sir, is partly the farming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the stream has fish?&rdquo; asked Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fish-pond,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;Ay, it is a pleasant
bit. It is pleasant even here, if one had time, with the
brook drumming in that black pool, and the green things
hanging all about the rocks, and, dear heart, to see the
very pebbles! all turned to gold and precious stones!
But you have come to that time of life, sir, when, if you
will excuse me, you must look to have the rheumatism
set in. Thirty to forty is, as one may say, their seed-time.
And this is a damp, cold corner for the early morning
and an empty stomach. If I might humbly advise you,
sir, I would be moving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Otto gravely. &ldquo;And so
you have lived your life here?&rdquo; he added, as they turned
to go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I was born,&rdquo; replied the farmer, &ldquo;and here I
wish I could say I was to die. But fortune, sir, fortune
turns the wheel. They say she is blind, but we will hope
she only sees a little farther on. My grandfather and my
father and I, we have all tilled these acres, my furrow following
theirs. All the three names are on the garden
bench, two Killians and one Johann. Yes, sir, good men
have prepared themselves for the great change in my old
garden. Well do I mind my father, in a woollen night-cap,
the good soul, going round and round to see the last
of it, &lsquo;Killian,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;do you see the smoke of my
tobacco? Why,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;that is man&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; It was
his last pipe, and I believe he knew it; and it was a strange
thing, without doubt, to leave the trees that he had planted,
and the son that he had begotten, ay, sir, and even the
old pipe with the Turk&rsquo;s head that he had smoked since
he was a lad and went a-courting. But here we have no
continuing city; and as for the eternal, it&rsquo;s a comfortable
thought that we have other merits than our own. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29"></a>29</span>
yet you would hardly think how sore it goes against the
grain with me, to die in a strange bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And must you do so? For what reason?&rdquo; Otto
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The reason? The place is to be sold: three thousand
crowns,&rdquo; replied Mr. Gottesheim. &ldquo;Had it been a
third of that, I may say without boasting that, what
with my credit and my savings, I could have met the
sum. But at three thousand, unless I have singular good
fortune and the new proprietor continues me in office,
there is nothing left me but to budge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto&rsquo;s fancy for the place redoubled at the news, and
became joined with other feelings. If all he heard were
true, Gr√ºnewald was growing very hot for a sovereign
Prince; it might be well to have a refuge; and if so,
what more delightful hermitage could man imagine? Mr.
Gottesheim, besides, had touched his sympathies. Every
man loves in his soul to play the part of the stage deity.
And to step down to the aid of the old farmer, who had
so roughly handled him in talk, was the ideal of a Fair
Revenge. Otto&rsquo;s thoughts brightened at the prospect,
and he began to regard himself with a renewed respect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can find you, I believe, a purchaser,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
one who would continue to avail himself of your skill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you, sir, indeed?&rdquo; said the old man. &ldquo;Well,
I shall be heartily obliged; for I begin to find a man may
practise resignation all his days, as he takes physic, and
not come to like it in the end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will have the papers drawn, you may even
burthen the purchase with your interest,&rdquo; said Otto.
&ldquo;Let it be assured to you through life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your friend, sir,&rdquo; insinuated Killian, &ldquo;would not,
perhaps, care to make the interest reversible? Fritz is
a good lad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fritz is young,&rdquo; said the Prince drily; &ldquo;he must
earn consideration, not inherit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has long worked upon the place, sir,&rdquo; insisted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30"></a>30</span>
Mr. Gottesheim; &ldquo;and at my great age, for I am seventy-eight
come harvest, it would be a troublesome thought
to the proprietor how to fill my shoes. It would be a
care spared to assure yourself of Fritz. And I believe
he might be tempted by a permanency.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The young man has unsettled views,&rdquo; returned
Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly the purchaser&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Killian.</p>

<p>A little spot of anger burned in Otto&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I am
the purchaser,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was what I might have guessed,&rdquo; replied the
farmer, bowing with an aged, obsequious dignity. &ldquo;You
have made an old man very happy; and I may say, indeed,
that I have entertained an angel unawares. Sir,
the great people of this world&mdash;and by that I mean those
who are great in station&mdash;if they had only hearts like
yours, how they would make the fires burn and the poor
sing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not judge them hardly, sir,&rdquo; said Otto.
&ldquo;We all have our frailties.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truly, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Gottesheim, with unction.
&ldquo;And by what name, sir, am I to address my generous
landlord?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The double recollection of an English traveller, whom
he had received the week before at court, and of an old
English rogue called Transome, whom he had known in
youth, came pertinently to the Prince&rsquo;s help. &ldquo;Transome,&rdquo;
he answered, &ldquo;is my name. I am an English
traveller. It is, to-day, Tuesday. On Thursday, before
noon, the money shall be ready. Let us meet, if you
please, in Mittwalden, at the &lsquo;Morning Star.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am, in all things lawful, your servant to command,&rdquo;
replied the farmer. &ldquo;An Englishman! You are a great
race of travellers. And has your lordship some experience
of land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had some interest of the kind before,&rdquo; returned
the Prince; &ldquo;not in Gerolstein, indeed. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31"></a>31</span>
fortune, as you say, turns the wheel, and I desire to be
beforehand with her revolutions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very right, sir, I am sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Killian.</p>

<p>They had been strolling with deliberation; but they
were now drawing near to the farmhouse, mounting by
the trellised pathway to the level of the meadow. A
little before them the sound of voices had been some
while audible, and now grew louder and more distinct
with every step of their advance. Presently, when they
emerged upon the top of the bank, they beheld Fritz and
Ottilia some way off; he, very black and bloodshot,
emphasising his hoarse speech with the smacking of his
fist against his palm; she, standing a little way off in
blowsy, voluble distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Mr. Gottesheim, and made as if he
would turn aside.</p>

<p>But Otto went straight towards the lovers, in whose
dissension he believed himself to have a share. And,
indeed, as soon as he had seen the Prince, Fritz had
stood tragic, as if awaiting and defying his approach.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, here you are!&rdquo; he cried, as soon as they were
near enough for easy speech. &ldquo;You are a man at least,
and must reply. What were you after? Why were you
two skulking in the bush? God!&rdquo; he broke out, turning
again upon Ottilia, &ldquo;to think that I should waste my
heart on you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; Otto cut in. &ldquo;You were
addressing me. In virtue of what circumstance am I to
render you an account of this young lady&rsquo;s conduct?
Are you her father? her brother? her husband?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, sir, you know as well as I,&rdquo; returned the peasant.
&ldquo;We keep company, she and I. I love her, and she is by
way of loving me; but all shall be above-board, I would
have her to know. I have a good pride of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I perceive I must explain to you what love
is,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;Its measure is kindness. It is very
possible that you are proud; but she, too, may have some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32"></a>32</span>
self-esteem; I do not speak for myself. And perhaps, if
your own doings were so curiously examined, you might
find it inconvenient to reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;These are all set-offs,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;You
know very well that a man is a man, and a woman only
a woman. That holds good all over, up and down. I
ask you a question, I ask it again, and here I stand.&rdquo; He
drew a mark and toed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you have studied liberal doctrines somewhat
deeper,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;you will perhaps change your
note. You are a man of false weights and measures, my
young friend. You have one scale for women, another
for men; one for princes, and one for farmer-folk. On
the prince who neglects his wife you can be most severe.
But what of the lover who insults his mistress? You
use the name of love. I should think this lady might
very fairly ask to be delivered from love of such a nature.
For if I, a stranger, had been one-tenth part so gross and
so discourteous, you would most righteously have broke
my head. It would have been in your part, as lover, to
protect her from such insolence. Protect her first,
then, from yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; quoth Mr. Gottesheim, who had been looking
on with his hands behind his tall old back, &ldquo;ay, that&rsquo;s
Scripture truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fritz was staggered, not only by the Prince&rsquo;s imperturbable
superiority of manner, but by a glimmering consciousness
that he himself was in the wrong. The appeal
to liberal doctrines had, besides, unmanned him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I was rude, I&rsquo;ll own to it. I
meant no ill, and did nothing out of my just rights; but
I am above all these old vulgar notions too; and if I spoke
sharp, I&rsquo;ll ask her pardon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Freely granted, Fritz,&rdquo; said Ottilia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But all this doesn&rsquo;t answer me,&rdquo; cried Fritz. &ldquo;I
ask what you two spoke about. She says she promised
not to tell; well, then, I mean to know. Civility is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33"></a>33</span>
civility; but I&rsquo;ll be no man&rsquo;s gull. I have a right to
common justice, if I <i>do</i> keep company!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you will ask Mr. Gottesheim,&rdquo; replied Otto, &ldquo;you
will find I have not spent my hours in idleness. I have,
since I arose this morning, agreed to buy the farm. So
far I will go to satisfy a curiosity which I condemn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, well, if there was business, that&rsquo;s another matter,&rdquo;
returned Fritz. &ldquo;Though it beats me why you could not
tell. But, of course, if the gentleman is to buy the farm,
I suppose there would naturally be an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said Mr. Gottesheim, with a strong
accent of conviction.</p>

<p>But Ottilia was much braver. &ldquo;There now!&rdquo; she
cried in triumph. &ldquo;What did I tell you? I told you I
was fighting your battles. Now you see! Think shame
of your suspicious temper! You should go down upon
your bended knees both to that gentleman and me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH THE PRINCE COLLECTS OPINIONS
BY THE WAY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">A little</span> before noon, Otto, by a triumph of man&oelig;uvring,
effected his escape. He was quit in this way of the ponderous
gratitude of Mr. Killian, and of the confidential
gratitude of poor Ottilia; but of Fritz he was not quit so
readily. That young politician, brimming with mysterious
glances, offered to lend his convoy as far as to the
high-road; and Otto, in fear of some residuary jealousy,
and for the girl&rsquo;s sake, had not the courage to gainsay
him; but he regarded his companion with uneasy glances,
and devoutly wished the business at an end. For some
time Fritz walked by the mare in silence; and they had
already traversed more than half the proposed distance
when, with something of a blush, he looked up and opened
fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you not,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what they call a
socialist?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, no,&rdquo; returned Otto, &ldquo;not precisely what they
call so. Why do you ask?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will tell you why,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I saw
from the first that you were a red progressional, and
nothing but the fear of old Killian kept you back. And
there, sir, you were right: old men are always cowards.
But nowadays, you see, there are so many groups: you
can never tell how far the likeliest kind of man may be
prepared to go; and I was never sure you were one of the
strong thinkers, till you hinted about women and free
love.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page35"></a>35</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried Otto, &ldquo;I never said a word of such
a thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not you!&rdquo; cried Fritz. &ldquo;Never a word to compromise!
You was sowing seed: ground-bait, our president
calls it. But it&rsquo;s hard to deceive me, for I know
all the agitators and their ways, and all the doctrines;
and between you and me,&rdquo; lowering his voice, &ldquo;I am
myself affiliated. O yes, I am a secret society man, and
here is my medal.&rdquo; And drawing out a green ribbon that
he wore about his neck, he held up, for Otto&rsquo;s inspection,
a pewter medal bearing the imprint of a Phoenix and
the legend <i>Libertas</i>. &ldquo;And so now you see you may
trust me,&rdquo; added Fritz. &ldquo;I am none of your alehouse
talkers; I am a convinced revolutionary.&rdquo; And he
looked meltingly upon Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; replied the Prince; &ldquo;that is very gratifying.
Well, sir, the great thing for the good of one&rsquo;s
country is, first of all, to be a good man. All springs from
there. For my part, although you are right in thinking
that I have to do with politics, I am unfit by intellect and
temper for a leading r√¥le. I was intended, I fear, for a
subaltern. Yet we have all something to command, Mr.
Fritz, if it be only our own temper; and a man about
to marry must look closely to himself. The husband&rsquo;s,
like the prince&rsquo;s, is a very artificial standing; and it is
hard to be kind in either. Do you follow that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, I follow that,&rdquo; replied the young man, sadly
chop-fallen over the nature of the information he had
elicited; and then brightening up: &ldquo;Is it,&rdquo; he ventured,
&ldquo;is it for an arsenal that you have bought the
farm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see about that,&rdquo; the Prince answered, laughing.
&ldquo;You must not be too zealous. And in the meantime,
if I were you, I would say nothing on the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, trust me, sir, for that,&rdquo; cried Fritz, as he pocketed
a crown. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;ve let nothing out; for I suspected&mdash;I
might say I knew it&mdash;from the first. And mind you,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page36"></a>36</span>
when a guide is required,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I know all the
forest paths.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto rode away, chuckling. This talk with Fritz had
vastly entertained him; nor was he altogether discontented
with his bearing at the farm; men, he was
able to tell himself, had behaved worse under smaller
provocation. And, to harmonise all, the road and the
April air were both delightful to his soul.</p>

<p>Up and down, and to and fro, ever mounting through
the wooded foothills, the broad, white high-road wound
onward into Gr√ºnewald. On either hand the pines stood
coolly rooted&mdash;green moss prospering, springs welling
forth between their knuckled spurs; and though some
were broad and stalwart, and others spiry and slender,
yet all stood firm in the same attitude and with the same
expression, like a silent army presenting arms.</p>

<p>The road lay all the way apart from towns and villages,
which it left on either hand. Here and there, indeed, in
the bottom of green glens, the Prince could spy a few
congregated roofs, or perhaps above him, on a shoulder,
the solitary cabin of a woodman. But the highway was
an international undertaking, and with its face set for
distant cities, scorned the little life of Gr√ºnewald. Hence
it was exceeding solitary. Near the frontier Otto met
a detachment of his own troops marching in the hot dust;
and he was recognised and somewhat feebly cheered as
he rode by. But from that time forth and for a long while
he was alone with the great woods.</p>

<p>Gradually the spell of pleasure relaxed; his own
thoughts returned, like stinging insects, in a cloud; and
the talk of the night before, like a shower of buffets, fell
upon his memory. He looked east and west for any comforter;
and presently he was aware of a cross-road coming
steeply down hill, and a horseman cautiously descending.
A human voice or presence, like a spring in the desert,
was now welcome in itself, and Otto drew bridle to await
the coming of this stranger. He proved to be a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37"></a>37</span>
red-faced, thick-lipped countryman, with a pair of fat
saddle-bags and a stone bottle at his waist; who, as
soon as the Prince hailed him, jovially, if somewhat
thickly, answered. At the same time he gave a beery
yaw in the saddle. It was clear his bottle was no longer
full.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you ride towards Mittwalden?&rdquo; asked the
Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As far as the cross-road to Tannenbrunn,&rdquo; the man
replied. &ldquo;Will you bear company?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With pleasure. I have even waited for you on the
chance,&rdquo; answered Otto.</p>

<p>By this time they were close alongside; and the man,
with the country-folk instinct, turned his cloudy vision
first of all on his companion&rsquo;s mount. &ldquo;The devil!&rdquo;
he cried. &ldquo;You ride a bonny mare, friend!&rdquo; And then
his curiosity being satisfied about the essential, he turned
his attention to that merely secondary matter, his companion&rsquo;s
face. He started. &ldquo;The Prince!&rdquo; he cried,
saluting, with another yaw that came near dismounting
him. &ldquo;I beg your pardon, your Highness, not to have
reco&rsquo;nised you at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince was vexed out of his self-possession.
&ldquo;Since you know me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is unnecessary we
should ride together. I will precede you, if you please.&rdquo;
And he was about to set spur to the grey mare, when
the half-drunken fellow, reaching over, laid his hand upon
the rein.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;prince or no prince, that is
not how one man should conduct himself with another.
What! You&rsquo;ll ride with me incog. and set me talking!
But if I know you, you&rsquo;ll preshede me, if you please!
Spy!&rdquo; And the fellow, crimson with drink and injured
vanity, almost spat the word into the Prince&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>A horrid confusion came over Otto. He perceived
that he had acted rudely, grossly presuming on his station.
And perhaps a little shiver of physical alarm mingled with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38"></a>38</span>
his remorse, for the fellow was very powerful, and not
more than half in the possession of his senses. &ldquo;Take
your hand from my rein,&rdquo; he said, with a sufficient assumption
of command; and when the man, rather to his
wonder, had obeyed: &ldquo;You should understand, sir,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;that while I might be glad to ride with you as
one person of sagacity with another, and so receive your
true opinions, it would amuse me very little to hear the
empty compliments you would address to me as Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think I would lie, do you?&rdquo; cried the man with
the bottle, purpling deeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you would,&rdquo; returned Otto, entering entirely
into his self-possession. &ldquo;You would not even show
me the medal you wear about your neck.&rdquo; For he had
caught a glimpse of a green ribbon at the fellow&rsquo;s throat.</p>

<p>The change was instantaneous: the red face became
mottled with yellow; a thick-fingered, tottering hand
made a clutch at the tell-tale ribbon. &ldquo;Medal!&rdquo; the
man cried, wonderfully sobered. &ldquo;I have no medal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;I will even tell you
what that medal bears: a Ph&oelig;nix burning, with the
word <i>Libertas</i>.&rdquo; The medallist remaining speechless,
&ldquo;You are a pretty fellow,&rdquo; continued Otto, smiling, &ldquo;to
complain of incivility from the man whom you conspire
to murder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; protested the man. &ldquo;Nay, never that;
nothing criminal for me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are strangely misinformed,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;Conspiracy
itself is criminal, and ensures the pain of death.
Nay, sir, death it is; I will guarantee my accuracy. Not
that you need be so deplorably affected, for I am no
officer. But those who mingle with politics should look
at both sides of the medal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness ...&rdquo; began the knight of the
bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! you are a Republican,&rdquo; cried Otto;
&ldquo;what have you to do with highnesses? But let us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39"></a>39</span>
continue to ride forward. Since you so much desire it,
I cannot find it in my heart to deprive you of my company.
And for that matter, I have a question to address
to you. Why, being so great a body of men&mdash;for you
are a great body&mdash;fifteen thousand, I have heard, but
that will be understated; am I right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man gurgled in his throat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, then, being so considerable a party,&rdquo; resumed
Otto, &ldquo;do you not come before me boldly with your
wants?&mdash;what do I say? with your commands? Have
I the name of being passionately devoted to my throne?
I can scarce suppose it. Come, then; show me your
majority, and I will instantly resign. Tell this to your
friends; assure them from me of my docility; assure
them that, however they conceive of my deficiencies,
they cannot suppose me more unfit to be a ruler than
I do myself. I am one of the worst princes in Europe;
will they improve on that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far be it from me ...&rdquo; the man began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, now, if you will not defend my government!&rdquo;
cried Otto. &ldquo;If I were you, I would leave conspiracies.
You are as little fit to be a conspirator as I to be a king.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One thing I will say out,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;It is
not so much you that we complain of, it&rsquo;s your lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word, sir,&rdquo; said the Prince; and then after
a moment&rsquo;s pause, and in tones of some anger and contempt:
&ldquo;I once more advise you to have done with
politics,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;and when next I see you, let me
see you sober. A morning drunkard is the last man to
sit in judgment even upon the worst of princes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have had a drop, but I had not been drinking,&rdquo;
the man replied, triumphing in a sound distinction. &ldquo;And
if I had, what then? Nobody hangs by me. But my
mill is standing idle, and I blame it on your wife. Am I
alone in that? Go round and ask. Where are the mills?
Where are the young men that should be working? Where
is the currency? All paralysed. No, sir, it is not equal;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40"></a>40</span>
for I suffer for your faults&mdash;I pay for them, by George,
out of a poor man&rsquo;s pocket. And what have you to do
with mine? Drunk or sober, I can see my country going
to hell, and I can see whose fault it is. And so now, I&rsquo;ve
said my say, and you may drag me to a stinking dungeon;
what care I? I&rsquo;ve spoke the truth, and so I&rsquo;ll hold hard,
and not intrude upon your Highness&rsquo;s society.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the miller reined up and, clumsily enough, saluted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will observe, I have not asked your name,&rdquo;
said Otto. &ldquo;I wish you a good ride,&rdquo; and he rode on
hard. But let him ride as he pleased, this interview with
the miller was a chokepear, which he could not swallow.
He had begun by receiving a reproof in manners, and
ended by sustaining a defeat in logic, both from a man
whom he despised. All his old thoughts returned with
fresher venom. And by three in the afternoon, coming
to the cross-roads for Beckstein, Otto decided to turn
aside and dine there leisurely. Nothing at least could
be worse than to go on as he was going.</p>

<p>In the inn at Beckstein he remarked, immediately
upon his entrance, an intelligent young gentleman dining,
with a book in front of him. He had his own place laid
close to the reader, and with a proper apology, broke
ground by asking what he read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am perusing,&rdquo; answered the young gentleman,
&ldquo;the last work of the Herr Doctor Hohenstockwitz,
cousin and librarian of your Prince here in Gr√ºnewald&mdash;a
man of great erudition and some lambencies of wit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am acquainted,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;with the Herr Doctor,
though not yet with his work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two privileges that I must envy you,&rdquo; replied the
young man politely: &ldquo;an honour in hand, a pleasure in
the bush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Herr Doctor is a man much respected, I believe,
for his attainments?&rdquo; asked the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is, sir, a remarkable instance of the force of intellect,&rdquo;
replied the reader. &ldquo;Who of our young men know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41"></a>41</span>
anything of his cousin, all-reigning Prince although he
be? Who but has heard of Dr. Gotthold? But intellectual
merit, alone of all distinctions, has its base in nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have the gratification of addressing a student&mdash;perhaps
an author?&rdquo; Otto suggested.</p>

<p>The young man somewhat flushed. &ldquo;I have some
claim to both distinctions, sir, as you suppose,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;there is my card. I am the licentiate Roederer, author
of several works on the theory and practice of politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You immensely interest me,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;the
more so as I gather that here in Gr√ºnewald we are on
the brink of revolution. Pray, since these have been
your special studies, would you augur hopefully of such
a movement?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; said the young author, with a certain
vinegary twitch, &ldquo;that you are unacquainted with my
opuscula. I am a convinced authoritarian. I share none
of those illusory, Utopian fancies with which empirics
blind themselves and exasperate the ignorant. The day
of these ideas is, believe me, past, or at least passing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When I look about me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When you look about you,&rdquo; interrupted the licentiate,
&ldquo;you behold the ignorant. But in the laboratory
of opinion, beside the studious lamp, we begin already
to discard these figments. We begin to return to nature&rsquo;s
order, to what I might call, if I were to borrow from
the language of therapeutics, the expectant treatment of
abuses. You will not misunderstand me,&rdquo; he continued:
&ldquo;a country in the condition in which we find Gr√ºnewald,
a prince such as your Prince Otto, we must explicitly
condemn; they are behind the age. But I would look
for a remedy not to brute convulsions, but to the natural
supervenience of a more able sovereign. I should amuse
you, perhaps,&rdquo; added the licentiate, with a smile, &ldquo;I think
I should amuse you if I were to explain my notion of a
prince. We who have studied in the closet, no longer, in
this age, propose ourselves for active service. The paths,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42"></a>42</span>
we have perceived, are incompatible. I would not have
a student on the throne, though I would have one near
by for an adviser. I would set forward as prince a man
of a good, medium understanding, lively rather than
deep; a man of courtly manner, possessed of the double
art to ingratiate and to command; receptive, accommodating,
seductive. I have been observing you since your
first entrance. Well, sir, were I a subject of Gr√ºnewald
I should pray Heaven to set upon the seat of government
just such another as yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The devil you would!&rdquo; exclaimed the Prince.</p>

<p>The licentiate Roederer laughed most heartily. &ldquo;I
thought I should astonish you,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These are not
the ideas of the masses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are not, I can assure you,&rdquo; Otto said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Or rather,&rdquo; distinguished the licentiate, &ldquo;not to-day.
The time will come, however, when these ideas
shall prevail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will permit me, sir, to doubt it,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Modesty is always admirable,&rdquo; chuckled the theorist.
&ldquo;But yet I assure you, a man like you, with such a man
as, say, Dr. Gotthold at your elbow, would be, for all
practical issues, my ideal ruler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this rate the hours sped pleasantly for Otto. But
the licentiate unfortunately slept that night at Beckstein,
where he was, being dainty in the saddle and given
to half stages. And to find a convoy to Mittwalden, and
thus mitigate the company of his own thoughts, the
Prince had to make favour with a certain party of wood-merchants
from various states of the empire, who had
been drinking together somewhat noisily at the far end
of the apartment.</p>

<p>The night had already fallen when they took the
saddle. The merchants were very loud and mirthful;
each had a face like a nor&rsquo;-west moon; and they played
pranks with each other&rsquo;s horses, and mingled songs and
choruses, and alternately remembered and forgot the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43"></a>43</span>
companion of their ride. Otto thus combined society and
solitude, hearkening now to their chattering and empty
talk, now to the voices of the encircling forest. The
star-lit dark, the faint wood airs, the clank of the horse-shoes
making broken music, accorded together and attuned
his mind, and he was still in a most equal temper when
the party reached the top of that long hill that overlooks
Mittwalden.</p>

<p>Down in the bottom of a bowl of forest, the lights of
the little formal town glittered in a pattern, street crossing
street; away by itself on the right, the palace was
glowing like a factory.</p>

<p>Although he knew not Otto, one of the wood-merchants
was a native of the state. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said
he, pointing to the palace with his whip, &ldquo;there is
Jezebel&rsquo;s inn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What, do you call it that?&rdquo; cried another, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay that&rsquo;s what they call it,&rdquo; returned the Gr√ºnewalder;
and he broke into a song, which the rest, as
people well acquainted with the words and air, instantly
took up in chorus. Her Serene Highness Amalia Seraphina,
Princess of Gr√ºnewald, was the heroine, Gondremark
the hero of this ballad. Shame hissed in Otto&rsquo;s
ears. He reined up short and sat stunned in the saddle;
and the singers continued to descend the hill without him.</p>

<p>The song went to a rough, swashing, popular air; and
long after the words became inaudible the swing of the
music, rising and falling, echoed insult in the Prince&rsquo;s
brain. He fled the sounds. Hard by him on his right
a road struck towards the palace, and he followed it through
the thick shadows and branching alleys of the park. It
was a busy place on a fine summer&rsquo;s afternoon, when the
court and burghers met and saluted; but at that hour
of the night in the early spring it was deserted to the
roosting birds. Hares rustled among the covert; here
and there a statue stood glimmering, with its eternal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44"></a>44</span>
gesture; here and there the echo of an imitation temple
clattered ghostly to the trampling of the mare. Ten
minutes brought him to the upper end of his own home
garden, where the small stables opened, over a bridge,
upon the park. The yard clock was striking the hour of
ten; so was the big bell in the palace bell-tower; and,
farther off, the belfries of the town. About the stable all
else was silent but the stamping of stalled horses and the
rattle of halters. Otto dismounted; and as he did so a
memory came back to him: a whisper of dishonest grooms
and stolen corn, once heard, long forgotten, and now recurring
in the nick of opportunity. He crossed the bridge,
and, going up to a window, knocked six or seven heavy
blows in a particular cadence, and, as he did so, smiled.
Presently a wicket was opened in the gate, and a man&rsquo;s
head appeared in the dim starlight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing to-night,&rdquo; said a voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bring a lantern,&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear heart a&rsquo; mercy!&rdquo; cried the groom. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is I, the Prince,&rdquo; replied Otto. &ldquo;Bring a
lantern, take in the mare, and let me through into the
garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man remained silent for a while, his head still
projecting through the wicket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Highness!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;And why did
your Highness knock so strange?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a superstition in Mittwalden,&rdquo; answered Otto,
&ldquo;that it cheapens corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sound like a sob the groom fled. He was
very white when he returned, even by the light of the
lantern; and his hand trembled as he undid the fastenings
and took the mare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; he began at last, &ldquo;for God&rsquo;s sake....&rdquo;
And there he paused, oppressed with guilt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, what?&rdquo; asked Otto cheerfully.
&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake let us have cheaper corn, say I. Good-night!&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45"></a>45</span>
And he strode off into the garden, leaving the
groom petrified once more.</p>

<p>The garden descended by a succession of stone terraces
to the level of the fish-pond. On the far side the
ground rose again, and was crowned by the confused roofs
and gables of the palace. The modern pillared front,
the ball-room, the great library, the princely apartments,
the busy and illuminated quarters of that great house, all
faced the town. The garden side was much older; and
here it was almost dark; only a few windows quietly
lighted at various elevations. The great square tower
rose, thinning by stages like a telescope; and on the
top of all the flag hung motionless.</p>

<p>The garden, as it now lay in the dusk and glimmer
of the starshine, breathed of April violets. Under night&rsquo;s
cavern arch the shrubs obscurely bustled. Through the
plotted terraces and down the marble stairs the Prince
rapidly descended, fleeing before uncomfortable thoughts.
But, alas! from these there is no city of refuge. And
now, when he was about midway of the descent, distant
strains of music began to fall upon his ear from the ball-room,
where the court was dancing. They reached him
faint and broken, but they touched the keys of memory;
and through and above them, Otto heard the ranting
melody of the wood-merchants&rsquo; song. Mere blackness
seized upon his mind. Here he was coming home; the
wife was dancing, the husband had been playing a trick
upon a lackey; and meanwhile, all about them, they
were a by-word to their subjects. Such a prince, such a
husband, such a man, as this Otto had become! And
he sped the faster onward.</p>

<p>Some way below he came unexpectedly upon a sentry;
yet a little farther, and he was challenged by a second;
and as he crossed the bridge over the fish-pond, an officer
making the rounds stopped him once more. The parade
of watch was more than usual; but curiosity was dead
in Otto&rsquo;s mind, and he only chafed at the interruption.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46"></a>46</span>
The porter of the back postern admitted him, and started
to behold him so disordered. Thence, hasting by private
stairs and passages, he came at length unseen to
his own chamber, tore off his clothes, and threw himself
upon his bed in the dark. The music of the ball-room still
continued to a very lively measure; and still, behind that,
he heard in spirit the chorus of the merchants clanking
down the hill.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LIBRARY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">At</span> a quarter before six on the following morning Dr.
Gotthold was already at his desk in the library; and
with a small cup of black coffee at his elbow, and an eye
occasionally wandering to the busts and the long array of
many-coloured books, was quietly reviewing the labours
of the day before. He was a man of about forty, flaxen-haired,
with refined features a little worn, and bright eyes
somewhat faded. Early to bed and early to rise, his life
was devoted to two things: erudition and Rhine wine.
An ancient friendship existed latent between him and
Otto; they rarely met, but when they did it was to take
up at once the thread of their suspended intimacy. Gotthold,
the virgin priest of knowledge, had envied his cousin,
for half a day, when he was married; he had never envied
him his throne.</p>

<p>Reading was not a popular diversion at the court of
Gr√ºnewald; and that great, pleasant, sunshiny gallery
of books and statues was, in practice, Gotthold&rsquo;s private
cabinet. On this particular Wednesday morning, however,
he had not been long about his manuscript when a
door opened and the Prince stepped into the apartment.
The Doctor watched him as he drew near, receiving, from
each of the embayed windows in succession, a flush of
morning sun; and Otto looked so gay, and walked so
airily, he was so well dressed and brushed and frizzled,
so <i>point-device</i>, and of such a sovereign elegance, that the
heart of his cousin the recluse was rather moved against
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50"></a>50</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Gotthold,&rdquo; said Otto, dropping in a
chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Otto,&rdquo; returned the librarian. &ldquo;You
are an early bird. Is this an accident, or do you begin
reforming?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is about time, I fancy,&rdquo; answered the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot imagine,&rdquo; said the Doctor. &ldquo;I am too
sceptical to be an ethical adviser; and as for good resolutions,
I believed in them when I was young. They are
the colours of hope&rsquo;s rainbow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come to think of it,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;I am not
a popular sovereign.&rdquo; And with a look he changed his
statement to a question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Popular? Well, there I would distinguish,&rdquo; answered
Gotthold, leaning back and joining the tips of his fingers.
&ldquo;There are various kinds of popularity: the bookish,
which is perfectly impersonal, as unreal as the nightmare;
the politician&rsquo;s, a mixed variety; and yours, which is
the most personal of all. Women take to you; footmen
adore you; it is as natural to like you as to pat a dog;
and were you a saw-miller you would be the most popular
citizen in Gr√ºnewald. As a prince&mdash;well, you are in the
wrong trade. It is perhaps philosophical to recognise it
as you do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps philosophical?&rdquo; repeated Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, perhaps. I would not be dogmatic,&rdquo; answered
Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps philosophical, and certainly not virtuous,&rdquo;
Otto resumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not of a Roman virtue,&rdquo; chuckled the recluse.</p>

<p>Otto drew his chair nearer to the table, leaned upon it
with his elbow, and looked his cousin squarely in the face.
&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;not manly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Gotthold hesitated, &ldquo;not manly, if you will.&rdquo;
And then, with a laugh, &ldquo;I did not know that you gave
yourself out to be manly,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It was one of
the points that I inclined to like about you; inclined, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51"></a>51</span>
believe, to admire. The names of virtues exercise a charm
on most of us; we must lay claim to all of them, however
incompatible; we must all be both daring and prudent;
we must all vaunt our pride and go to the stake for our
humility. Not so you. Without compromise you were
yourself: a pretty sight. I have always said it: none
so void of all pretence as Otto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretence and effort both!&rdquo; cried Otto. &ldquo;A dead
dog in a canal is more alive. And the question, Gotthold,
the question that I have to face is this: Can I not,
with effort and self-denial, can I not become a tolerable
sovereign?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied Gotthold. &ldquo;Dismiss the notion.
And besides, dear child, you would not try.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, Gotthold, I am not to be put by,&rdquo; said Otto.
&ldquo;If I am constitutionally unfit to be a sovereign, what
am I doing with this money, with this palace, with these
guards? And I&mdash;a thief&mdash;am I to execute the law on
others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admit the difficulty,&rdquo; said Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, can I not try?&rdquo; continued Otto. &ldquo;Am I
not bound to try? And with the advice and help of
such a man as you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried the librarian. &ldquo;Now, God forbid!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto, though he was in no very smiling humour, could
not forbear to smile. &ldquo;Yet I was told last night,&rdquo; he
laughed, &ldquo;that with a man like me to impersonate, and
a man like you to touch the springs, a very possible government
could be composed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now I wonder in what diseased imagination,&rdquo; Gotthold
said, &ldquo;that preposterous monster saw the light of
day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was one of your own trade&mdash;a writer: one
Roederer,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Roederer! an ignorant puppy!&rdquo; cried the librarian.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are ungrateful,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;He is one of your
professed admirers.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page52"></a>52</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; cried Gotthold, obviously impressed.
&ldquo;Come, that is a good account of the young man. I
must read his stuff again. It is the rather to his credit,
as our views are opposite. The east and west are not
more opposite. Can I have converted him? But no;
the incident belongs to Fairyland.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not then,&rdquo; asked the Prince, &ldquo;an authoritarian?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? God bless me, no!&rdquo; said Gotthold. &ldquo;I am
a red, dear child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That brings me then to my next point, and by a
natural transition. If I am so clearly unfitted for my
post,&rdquo; the Prince asked: &ldquo;if my friends admit it, if my
subjects clamour for my downfall, if revolution is preparing
at this hour, must I not go forth to meet the inevitable?
should I not save these horrors and be done
with these absurdities? in a word, should I not abdicate?
O, believe me, I feel the ridicule, the vast abuse of language,&rdquo;
he added, wincing, &ldquo;but even a principulus like
me cannot resign; he must make a great gesture, and
come buskined forth, and abdicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; said Gotthold, &ldquo;or else stay where he is. What
gnat has bitten you to-day? Do you not know that
you are touching, with lay hands, the very holiest inwards
of philosophy, where madness dwells? Ay, Otto, madness;
for in the serene temples of the wise, the inmost
shrine, which we carefully keep locked, is full of spiders&rsquo;
webs. All men, all, are fundamentally useless; nature
tolerates, she does not need, she does not use them: sterile
flowers! All&mdash;down to the fellow swinking in a byre,
whom fools point out for the exception&mdash;all are useless;
all weave ropes of sand; or, like a child that has breathed
on a window, write and obliterate, write and obliterate,
idle words! Talk of it no more. That way, I tell you,
madness lies.&rdquo; The speaker rose from his chair and then
sat down again. He laughed a little laugh, and then,
changing his tone, resumed: &ldquo;Yes, dear child, we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"></a>53</span>
not here to do battle with giants; we are here to be happy
like the flowers, if we can be. It is because you could,
that I have always secretly admired you. Cling to that
trade; believe me, it is the right one. Be happy, be idle,
be airy. To the devil with all casuistry! and leave the
state to Gondremark, as heretofore. He does it well
enough, they say; and his vanity enjoys the situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gotthold,&rdquo; cried Otto, &ldquo;what is this to me? Useless
is not the question; I cannot rest at uselessness; I
must be useful or I must be noxious&mdash;one or other. I
grant you the whole thing, prince and principality alike, is
pure absurdity, a stroke of satire; and that a banker or
the man who keeps an inn has graver duties. But now,
when I have washed my hands of it three years, and left all&mdash;labour,
responsibility, and honour and enjoyment too,
if there be any&mdash;to Gondremark and to&mdash;Seraphina&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He hesitated at the name, and Gotthold glanced aside.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the Prince continued, &ldquo;what has come of it?
Taxes, army, cannon&mdash;why, it&rsquo;s like a box of lead soldiers!
And the people sick at the folly of it, and fired
with the injustice! And war, too&mdash;I hear of war&mdash;war
in this teapot! What a complication of absurdity and
disgrace! And when the inevitable end arrives&mdash;the
revolution&mdash;who will be to blame in the sight of God, who
will be gibbeted in public opinion? I! Prince Puppet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you had despised public opinion,&rdquo; said
Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said Otto sombrely, &ldquo;but now I do not. I
am growing old. And then, Gotthold, there is Seraphina.
She is loathed in this country that I brought her to and
suffered her to spoil. Yes, I gave it her as a plaything,
and she has broken it: a fine Prince, an admirable Princess!
Even her life&mdash;I ask you, Gotthold, is her life
safe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is safe enough to-day,&rdquo; replied the librarian: &ldquo;but
since you ask me seriously, I would not answer for to-morrow.
She is ill-advised.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page54"></a>54</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And by whom? By this Gondremark, to whom
you counsel me to leave my country,&rdquo; cried the Prince.
&ldquo;Rare advice! The course that I have been following
all these years, to come at last to this. O, ill-advised!
if that were all! See now, there is no sense in beating
about the bush between two men: you know what scandal
says of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gotthold, with pursed lips, silently nodded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, come, you are not very cheering as to my
conduct as the Prince; have I even done my duty as a
husband?&rdquo; Otto asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay,&rdquo; said Gotthold, earnestly and eagerly,
&ldquo;this is another chapter. I am an old celibate, an old
monk. I cannot advise you in your marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor do I require advice,&rdquo; said Otto, rising. &ldquo;All
of this must cease.&rdquo; And he began to walk to and fro
with his hands behind his back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Otto, may God guide you!&rdquo; said Gotthold,
after a considerable silence. &ldquo;I cannot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From what does all this spring?&rdquo; said the Prince,
stopping in his walk. &ldquo;What am I to call it? Diffidence?
The fear of ridicule? Inverted vanity? What
matter names, if it has brought me to this? I could
never bear to be bustling about nothing; I was ashamed
of this toy kingdom from the first; I could not tolerate
that people should fancy I believed in a thing so patently
absurd! I would do nothing that cannot be done smiling.
I have a sense of humour, forsooth! I must know
better than my Maker. And it was the same thing in
my marriage,&rdquo; he added more hoarsely. &ldquo;I did not
believe this girl could care for me; I must not intrude;
I must preserve the foppery of my indifference. What
an impotent picture!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, we have the same blood,&rdquo; moralised Gotthold.
&ldquo;You are drawing, with fine strokes, the character of
the born sceptic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sceptic?&mdash;coward!&rdquo; cried Otto. &ldquo;Coward is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55"></a>55</span>
the word. A springless, putty-hearted, cowering
coward!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And as the Prince rapped out the words in tones of
unusual vigour, a little, stout old gentleman, opening a
door behind Gotthold, received them fairly in the face.
With his parrot&rsquo;s beak for a nose, his pursed mouth, his
little goggling eyes, he was the picture of formality; and
in ordinary circumstances, strutting behind the drum of
his corporation, he impressed the beholder with a certain
air of frozen dignity and wisdom. But at the smallest
contrariety, his trembling hands and disconnected gestures
betrayed the weakness at the root. And now, when
he was thus surprisingly received in that library of Mittwalden
Palace, which was the customary haunt of silence,
his hands went up into the air as if he had been shot,
and he cried aloud with the scream of an old woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; he gasped, recovering, &ldquo;your Highness! I
beg ten thousand pardons. But your Highness at such
an hour in the library!&mdash;a circumstance so unusual as your
Highness&rsquo;s presence was a thing I could not be expected
to foresee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no harm done, Herr Cancellarius,&rdquo; said
Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came upon the errand of a moment: some papers
I left over-night with the Herr Doctor,&rdquo; said the Chancellor
of Gr√ºnewald.&mdash;&ldquo;Herr Doctor, if you will kindly
give me them, I will intrude no longer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gotthold unlocked a drawer and handed a bundle of
manuscript to the old gentleman, who prepared, with
fitting salutations, to take his departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr Greisengesang, since we have met,&rdquo; said Otto,
&ldquo;let us talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honoured by his Highness&rsquo;s commands,&rdquo; replied
the Chancellor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All has been quiet since I left?&rdquo; asked the Prince,
resuming his seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The usual business, your Highness,&rdquo; answered Greisengesang;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56"></a>56</span>
&ldquo;punctual trifles: huge, indeed, if neglected,
but trifles when discharged. Your Highness is most
zealously obeyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obeyed, Herr Cancellarius?&rdquo; returned the Prince.
&ldquo;And when have I obliged you with an order? Replaced,
let us rather say. But to touch upon these trifles;
instance me a few.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The routine of government, from which your Highness
has so wisely dissociated his leisure ...&rdquo; began
Greisengesang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We will leave my leisure, sir,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;Approach
the facts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The routine of business was proceeded with,&rdquo; replied
the official, now visibly twittering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very strange, Herr Cancellarius, that you should
so persistently avoid my questions,&rdquo; said the Prince.
&ldquo;You tempt me to suppose a purpose in your dulness. I
have asked you whether all was quiet; do me the pleasure
to reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perfectly&mdash;O, perfectly quiet,&rdquo; jerked the ancient
puppet, with every signal of untruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make a note of these words,&rdquo; said the Prince
gravely. &ldquo;You assure me, your sovereign, that since
the date of my departure nothing has occurred of which
you owe me an account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I take your Highness, I take the Herr Doctor to
witness,&rdquo; cried Greisengesang, &ldquo;that I have had no such
expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; said the Prince; and then, after a pause:
&ldquo;Herr Greisengesang, you are an old man, and you
served my father before you served me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It
consists neither with your dignity nor mine that you
should babble excuses and stumble possibly upon untruths.
Collect your thoughts; and then categorically
inform me of all you have been charged to hide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gotthold, stooping very low over his desk, appeared to
have resumed his labours; but his shoulders heaved with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57"></a>57</span>
subterranean merriment. The Prince waited, drawing
his handkerchief quietly through his fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness, in this informal manner,&rdquo; said the
old gentleman at last, &ldquo;and being unavoidably deprived
of documents, it would be difficult, it would be impossible,
to do justice to the somewhat grave occurrences which
have transpired.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not criticise your attitude,&rdquo; replied the Prince.
&ldquo;I desire that, between you and me, all should be done
gently; for I have not forgotten, my old friend, that you
were kind to me from the first, and for a period of years
a faithful servant. I will thus dismiss the matters on
which you waive immediate inquiry. But you have certain
papers actually in your hand. Come, Herr Greisengesang,
there is at least one point for which you have
authority. Enlighten me on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On that?&rdquo; cried the old gentleman. &ldquo;O, that is
a trifle; a matter, your Highness, of police; a detail of
a purely administrative order. These are simply a selection
of the papers seized upon the English traveller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seized?&rdquo; echoed Otto. &ldquo;In what sense? Explain
yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John Crabtree,&rdquo; interposed Gotthold, looking up,
&ldquo;was arrested yesterday evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this so, Herr Cancellarius?&rdquo; demanded Otto
sternly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was judged right, your Highness,&rdquo; protested Greisengesang.
&ldquo;The decree was in due form, invested with
your Highness&rsquo;s authority by procuration. I am but an
agent; I had no status to prevent the measure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This man, my guest, has been arrested,&rdquo; said the
Prince. &ldquo;On what grounds, sir? With what colour of
pretence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chancellor stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness will perhaps find the reason in these
documents,&rdquo; said Gotthold, pointing with the tail of his
pen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page58"></a>58</span></p>

<p>Otto thanked his cousin with a look. &ldquo;Give them
to me,&rdquo; he said, addressing the Chancellor.</p>

<p>But that gentleman visibly hesitated to obey. &ldquo;Baron
von Gondremark,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;has made the affair his
own. I am in this case a mere messenger; and as such,
I am not clothed with any capacity to communicate the
documents I carry. Herr Doctor, I am convinced you
will not fail to bear me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard a great deal of nonsense,&rdquo; said Gotthold,
&ldquo;and most of it from you; but this beats all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; said Otto, rising, &ldquo;the papers. I command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Greisengesang instantly gave way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;With your Highness&rsquo;s permission,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
laying at his feet my most submiss apologies, I will now
hasten to attend his further orders in the Chancery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr Cancellarius, do you see this chair?&rdquo; said
Otto. &ldquo;There is where you shall attend my further
orders. Oh, now, no more!&rdquo; he cried, with a gesture,
as the old man opened his lips. &ldquo;You have sufficiently
marked your zeal to your employer; and I begin to weary
of a moderation you abuse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chancellor moved to the appointed chair and took
his seat in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Otto, opening the roll, &ldquo;what is
all this? It looks like the manuscript of a book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said Gotthold, &ldquo;the manuscript of a book
of travels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have read it, Dr. Hohenstockwitz?&rdquo; asked the
Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, I but saw the title-page,&rdquo; replied Gotthold.
&ldquo;But the roll was given to me open, and I heard no word
of any secrecy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto dealt the Chancellor an angry glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The papers of an author
seized at this date of the world&rsquo;s history, in a state so
petty and so ignorant as Gr√ºnewald, here is indeed an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59"></a>59</span>
ignominious folly. Sir,&rdquo; to the Chancellor, &ldquo;I marvel
to find you in so scurvy an employment. On your conduct
to your Prince I will not dwell; but to descend to
be a spy! For what else can it be called? To seize the
papers of this gentleman, the private papers of a stranger,
the toil of a life, perhaps&mdash;to open, and to read them.
And what have we to do with books? The Herr Doctor
might perhaps be asked for his advice; but we have no
<i>index expurgatorius</i> in Gr√ºnewald. Had we but that, we
should be the most absolute parody and farce upon this
tawdry earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Yet, even while Otto spoke, he had continued to unfold
the roll; and now, when it lay fully open, his eye
rested on the title-page elaborately written in red ink.
It ran thus:</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="center">MEMOIRS</p>
<p class="center">OF A VISIT TO THE VARIOUS</p>
<p class="center">COURTS OF EUROPE</p>
<p class="center">BY</p>
<p class="center">SIR JOHN CRABTREE, BARONET</p>
<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Below was a list of chapters, each bearing the name
of one of the European Courts; and among these the
nineteenth and the last upon the list was dedicated to
Gr√ºnewald.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah! The Court of Gr√ºnewald!&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;that
should be droll reading.&rdquo; And his curiosity itched
for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A methodical dog, this English Baronet,&rdquo; said Gotthold.
&ldquo;Each chapter written and finished on the spot.
I shall look for his work when it appears.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be odd, now, just to glance at it,&rdquo; said Otto,
wavering.</p>

<p>Gotthold&rsquo;s brow darkened, and he looked out of
window.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60"></a>60</span></p>

<p>But though the Prince understood the reproof, his
weakness prevailed. &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; he said, with an uneasy
laugh, &ldquo;I will, I think, just glance at it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he resumed his seat and spread the traveller&rsquo;s
manuscript upon the table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"></a>61</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>&ldquo;ON THE COURT OF GR√úNEWALD,&rdquo; BEING A PORTION
OF THE TRAVELLER&rsquo;S MANUSCRIPT</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> may well be asked (<i>it was thus the English traveller
began his nineteenth chapter</i>) why I should have chosen
Gr√ºnewald out of so many other states equally petty,
formal, dull, and corrupt. Accident, indeed, decided, and
not I; but I have seen no reason to regret my visit. The
spectacle of this small society macerating in its own abuses
was not perhaps instructive, but I have found it exceedingly
diverting.</p>

<p>The reigning Prince, Otto Johann Friedrich, a young
man of imperfect education, questionable valour, and no
scintilla of capacity, has fallen into entire public contempt.
It was with difficulty that I obtained an interview,
for he is frequently absent from a court where his
presence is unheeded, and where his only r√¥le is to be
a cloak for the amours of his wife. At last, however,
on the third occasion when I visited the palace, I found
this sovereign in the exercise of his inglorious function,
with the wife on one hand and the lover on the other.
He is not ill-looking; he has hair of a ruddy gold, which
naturally curls, and his eyes are dark, a combination
which I always regard as the mark of some congenital
deficiency, physical or moral; his features are irregular
but pleasing; the nose perhaps a little short, and the
mouth a little womanish; his address is excellent, and he
can express himself with point. But to pierce below these
externals is to come on a vacuity of any sterling quality,
a deliquescence of the moral nature, a frivolity and inconsequence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62"></a>62</span>
of purpose that mark the nearly perfect
fruit of a decadent age. He has a worthless smattering
of many subjects, but a grasp of none. &ldquo;I soon weary
of a pursuit,&rdquo; he said to me, laughing; it would almost
appear as if he took a pride in his incapacity and lack of
moral courage. The results of his dilettanteism are to
be seen in every field; he is a bad fencer, a second-rate
horseman, dancer, shot; he sings&mdash;I have heard him&mdash;and
he sings like a child; he writes intolerable verses in
more than doubtful French; he acts like the common
amateur; and in short there is no end to the number
of things that he does, and does badly. His one manly
taste is for the chase. In sum, he is but a plexus of weaknesses;
the singing chambermaid of the stage, tricked
out in man&rsquo;s apparel, and mounted on a circus horse. I
have seen this poor phantom of a prince riding out alone
or with a few huntsmen, disregarded by all, and I have
been even grieved for the bearer of so futile and melancholy
an existence. The last Merovingians may have
looked not otherwise.</p>

<p>The Princess Amalia Seraphina, a daughter of the
Grand-Ducal house of Toggenburg-Tannh√§user, would be
equally inconsiderable if she were not a cutting instrument
in the hands of an ambitious man. She is much
younger than the Prince, a girl of two-and-twenty, sick
with vanity, superficially clever, and fundamentally a
fool. She has a red-brown rolling eye, too large for her
face, and with sparks of both levity and ferocity; her
forehead is high and narrow, her figure thin and a little
stooping. Her manners, her conversation, which she
interlards with French, her very tastes and ambitions,
are alike assumed, and the assumption is ungracefully
apparent: Hoyden playing Cleopatra. I should judge
her to be incapable of truth. In private life a girl of this
description embroils the peace of families, walks attended
by a troop of scowling swains, and passes, once at least,
through the divorce court; it is a common and, except
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63"></a>63</span>
to the cynic, an uninteresting type. On the throne, however,
and in the hands of a man like Gondremark, she
may become the authoress of serious public evils.</p>

<p>Gondremark, the true ruler of this unfortunate country,
is a more complex study. His position in Gr√ºnewald,
to which he is a foreigner, is eminently false; and that
he should maintain it as he does, a very miracle of impudence
and dexterity. His speech, his face, his policy,
are all double: heads and tails. Which of the two
extremes may be his actual design he were a bold man
who should offer to decide. Yet I will hazard the guess
that he follows both experimentally, and awaits, at the
hand of destiny, one of those directing hints of which she
is so lavish to the wise.</p>

<p>On the one hand, as <i>Maire du Palais</i> to the incompetent
Otto, and using the love-sick Princess for a tool and
mouthpiece, he pursues a policy of arbitrary power and
territorial aggrandisement. He has called out the whole
capable male population of the state to military service;
he has bought cannon; he has tempted away promising
officers from foreign armies; and he now begins, in his
international relations, to assume the swaggering port
and the vague threatful language of a bully. The idea of
extending Gr√ºnewald may appear absurd, but the little
state is advantageously placed, its neighbours are all
defenceless; and if at any moment the jealousies of the
greater courts should neutralise each other, an active policy
might double the principality both in population and
extent. Certainly at least the scheme is entertained in
the court of Mittwalden; nor do I myself regard it as
entirely desperate. The margravate of Brandenburg has
grown from as small beginnings to a formidable power;
and though it is late in the day to try adventurous policies,
and the age of war seems ended, Fortune, we must
not forget, still blindly turns her wheel for men and
nations. Concurrently with, and tributary to, these
warlike preparations, crushing taxes have been levied,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64"></a>64</span>
journals have been suppressed, and the country, which
three years ago was prosperous and happy, now stagnates
in a forced inaction, gold has become a curiosity, and
the mills stand idle on the mountain streams.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in his second capacity of popular
tribune, Gondremark is the incarnation of the free lodges,
and sits at the centre of an organised conspiracy against
the state. To any such movement my sympathies were
early acquired, and I would not willingly let fall a word
that might embarrass or retard the revolution. But to
show that I speak of knowledge, and not as the reporter
of mere gossip, I may mention that I have myself been
present at a meeting where the details of a republican
Constitution were minutely debated and arranged; and
I may add that Gondremark was throughout referred to by
the speakers as their captain in action and the arbiter
of their disputes. He has taught his dupes (for so I must
regard them) that his power of resistance to the Princess
is limited, and at each fresh stretch of authority persuades
them, with specious reasons, to postpone the hour of insurrection.
Thus (to give some instances of his astute
diplomacy) he salved over the decree enforcing military
service, under the plea that to be well drilled and exercised
in arms was even a necessary preparation for revolt.
And the other day, when it began to be rumoured abroad
that a war was being forced on a reluctant neighbour,
the Grand Duke of Gerolstein, and I made sure it would
be the signal for an instant rising, I was struck dumb
with wonder to find that even this had been prepared
and was to be accepted. I went from one to another
in the Liberal camp, and all were in the same story, all
had been drilled and schooled and fitted out with vacuous
argument. &ldquo;The lads had better see some real fighting,&rdquo;
they said; &ldquo;and besides, it will be as well to capture
Gerolstein; we can then extend to our neighbours the
blessing of liberty on the same day that we snatch it for
ourselves; and the republic will be all the stronger to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65"></a>65</span>
resist, if the kings of Europe should band themselves
together to reduce it.&rdquo; I know not which of the two I
should admire the more: the simplicity of the multitude
or the audacity of the adventurer. But such are the
subtleties, such the quibbling reasons, with which he
blinds and leads this people. How long a course so tortuous
can be pursued with safety I am incapable of guessing;
not long, one would suppose; and yet this singular
man has been treading the mazes for five years, and his
favour at court and his popularity among the lodges
still endure unbroken.</p>

<p>I have the privilege of slightly knowing him. Heavily
and somewhat clumsily built, of a vast, disjointed, rambling
frame, he can still pull himself together, and figure,
not without admiration, in the saloon or the ball-room.
His hue and temperament are plentifully bilious; he has
a saturnine eye; his cheek is of a dark blue where he has
been shaven. Essentially he is to be numbered among
the man-haters, a convinced contemner of his fellows.
Yet he is himself of a most commonplace ambition and
greedy of applause. In talk, he is remarkable for a thirst
of information, loving rather to hear than to communicate;
for sound and studious views; and, judging by
the extreme short-sightedness of common politicians, for
a remarkable prevision of events. All this, however,
without grace, pleasantry, or charm, heavily set forth,
with a dull countenance. In our numerous conversations,
although he has always heard me with deference, I have
been conscious throughout of a sort of ponderous finessing
hard to tolerate. He produces none of the effect of a
gentleman; devoid not merely of pleasantry, but of all
attention or communicative warmth of bearing. No
gentleman, besides, would so parade his amours with
the Princess; still less repay the Prince for his long-suffering
with the studied insolence of demeanour and the
fabrication of insulting nicknames, such as Prince Featherhead,
which run from ear to ear and create a laugh
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66"></a>66</span>
throughout the country. Gondremark has thus some of
the clumsier characters of the self-made man, combined
with an inordinate, almost a besotted, pride of intellect
and birth. Heavy, bilious, selfish, inornate, he sits upon
this court and country like an incubus.</p>

<p>But it is probable that he preserves softer gifts for
necessary purposes. Indeed, it is certain, although he
vouchsafed none of it to me, that this cold and stolid
politician possesses to a great degree the art of ingratiation,
and can be all things to all men. Hence there has
probably sprung up the idle legend that in private life he
is a gross romping voluptuary. Nothing, at least, can
well be more surprising than the terms of his connection
with the Princess. Older than her husband, certainly
uglier, and, according to the feeble ideas common among
women, in every particular less pleasing, he has not only
seized the complete command of all her thought and
action, but has imposed on her in public a humiliating
part. I do not here refer to the complete sacrifice of every
rag of her reputation; for to many women these extremities
are in themselves attractive. But there is about the
court a certain lady of a dishevelled reputation, a Countess
von Rosen, wife or widow of a cloudy count, no longer in
her second youth, and already bereft of some of her attractions,
who unequivocally occupies the station of the
Baron&rsquo;s mistress. I had thought, at first, that she was
but a hired accomplice, a mere blind or buffer for the
more important sinner. A few hours&rsquo; acquaintance with
Madame von Rosen for ever dispelled the illusion. She is
one rather to make than to prevent a scandal, and she
values none of those bribes&mdash;money, honours, or employment&mdash;with
which the situation might be gilded. Indeed,
as a person frankly bad, she pleased me, in the court of
Gr√ºnewald, like a piece of nature.</p>

<p>The power of this man over the Princess is, therefore,
without bounds. She has sacrificed to the adoration
with which he has inspired her not only her marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67"></a>67</span>
vow and every shred of public decency, but that vice
of jealousy which is so much dearer to the female sex
than either intrinsic honour or outward consideration.
Nay, more: a young, although not a very attractive
woman, and a princess both by birth and fact, she submits
to the triumphant rivalry of one who might be
her mother as to years, and who is so manifestly her
inferior in station. This is one of the mysteries of the
human heart. But the rage of illicit love, when it is once
indulged, appears to grow by feeding; and to a person of
the character and temperament of this unfortunate young
lady, almost any depth of degradation is within the reach
of possibility.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE PRINCE AND THE ENGLISH TRAVELLER</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">So</span> far Otto read, with waxing indignation; and here his
fury overflowed. He tossed the roll upon the table and
stood up. &ldquo;This man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is a devil. A filthy
imagination, an ear greedy of evil, a ponderous malignity
of thought and language: I grow like him by the reading!
Chancellor, where is this fellow lodged?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was committed to the Flag Tower,&rdquo; replied
Greisengesang, &ldquo;in the Gamiani apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead me to him,&rdquo; said the Prince; and then, a
thought striking him, &ldquo;Was it for that,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that
I found so many sentries in the garden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness, I am unaware,&rdquo; answered Greisengesang,
true to his policy. &ldquo;The disposition of the guards
is a matter distinct from my functions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto turned upon the old man fiercely, but ere he had
time to speak, Gotthold touched him on the arm. He
swallowed his wrath with a great effort. &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo;
he said, taking the roll. &ldquo;Follow me to the Flag Tower.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chancellor gathered himself together, and the
two set forward. It was a long and complicated voyage;
for the library was in the wing of the new buildings, and
the tower which carried the flag was in the old schloss
upon the garden. By a great variety of stairs and corridors,
they came out at last upon a patch of gravelled
court; the garden peeped through a high grating with a
flash of green; tall, old, gabled buildings mounted on
every side; the Flag Tower climbed, stage after stage,
into the blue; and high over all, among the building
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69"></a>69</span>
daws, the yellow flag wavered in the wind. A sentinel
at the foot of the tower stairs presented arms; another
paced the first landing; and a third was stationed before
the door of the extemporised prison.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We guard this mud-bag like a jewel,&rdquo; Otto sneered.</p>

<p>The Gamiani apartment was so called from an Italian
doctor who had imposed on the credulity of a former
prince. The rooms were large, airy, pleasant, and looked
upon the garden; but the walls were of great thickness
(for the tower was old), and the windows were heavily
barred. The Prince, followed by the Chancellor, still
trotting to keep up with him, brushed swiftly through
the little library and the long saloon, and burst like a
thunderbolt into the bedroom at the farther end. Sir
John was finishing his toilet; a man of fifty, hard, uncompromising,
able, with the eye and teeth of physical
courage. He was unmoved by the irruption, and bowed
with a sort of sneering ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To what am I to attribute the honour of this visit?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have eaten my bread,&rdquo; replied Otto, &ldquo;you
have taken my hand, you have been received under my
roof. When did I fail you in courtesy? What have you
asked that was not granted as to an honoured guest?
And here, sir,&rdquo; tapping fiercely on the manuscript, &ldquo;here
is your return.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness has read my papers?&rdquo; said the
Baronet. &ldquo;I am honoured indeed. But the sketch is
most imperfect. I shall now have much to add. I can
say that the Prince, whom I had accused of idleness, is
zealous in the department of police, taking upon himself
those duties that are most distasteful. I shall be able
to relate the burlesque incident of my arrest, and the
singular interview with which you honour me at present.
For the rest, I have already communicated with my
Ambassador at Vienna; and unless you propose to
murder me, I shall be at liberty, whether you please or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70"></a>70</span>
not, within the week. For I hardly fancy the future empire
of Gr√ºnewald is yet ripe to go to war with England.
I conceive I am a little more than quits. I owe you no
explanation; yours has been the wrong. You, if you
have studied my writing with intelligence, owe me a large
debt of gratitude. And to conclude, as I have not yet
finished my toilet, I imagine the courtesy of a turnkey
to a prisoner would induce you to withdraw.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was some paper on the table, and Otto, sitting
down, wrote a passport in the name of Sir John Crabtree.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Affix the seal, Herr Cancellarius,&rdquo; he said, in his most
princely manner, as he rose.</p>

<p>Greisengesang produced a red portfolio, and affixed
the seal in the unpoetic guise of an adhesive stamp; nor
did his perturbed and clumsy movements at all lessen
the comedy of the performance. Sir John looked on with
a malign enjoyment; and Otto chafed, regretting, when
too late, the unnecessary royalty of his command and
gesture. But at length the Chancellor had finished his
piece of prestidigitation, and, without waiting for an order,
had countersigned the passport. Thus regularised, he
returned it to Otto with a bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will now,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;order one of my
own carriages to be prepared; see it, with your own eyes,
charged with Sir John&rsquo;s effects, and have it waiting within
the hour behind the Pheasant House. Sir John departs
this morning for Vienna.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chancellor took his elaborate departure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, sir, is your passport,&rdquo; said Otto, turning to
the Baronet. &ldquo;I regret it from my heart that you have
met inhospitable usage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there will be no English war,&rdquo; returned Sir
John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; said Otto; &ldquo;you surely owe me your
civility. Matters are now changed, and we stand again
upon the footing of two gentlemen. It was not I who
ordered your arrest; I returned late last night from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71"></a>71</span>
hunting; and as you cannot blame me for your imprisonment,
you may even thank me for your freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet you read my papers,&rdquo; said the traveller
shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, sir, I was wrong,&rdquo; returned Otto; &ldquo;and for
that I ask your pardon. You can scarce refuse it, for
your own dignity, to one who is a plexus of weaknesses.
Nor was the fault entirely mine. Had the papers been
innocent, it would have been at most an indiscretion.
Your own guilt is the sting of my offence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir John regarded Otto with an approving twinkle;
then he bowed, but still in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, as you are now at your entire disposal, I
have a favour to beg of your indulgence,&rdquo; continued the
Prince. &ldquo;I have to request that you will walk with
me alone into the garden so soon as your convenience
permits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the moment that I am a free man,&rdquo; Sir John
replied, this time with perfect courtesy, &ldquo;I am wholly
at your Highness&rsquo;s command; and if you will excuse
a rather summary toilet, I will even follow you as I
am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>So without more delay, the Prince leading, the pair
proceeded down through the echoing stairway of the
tower, and out through the grating, into the ample air
and sunshine of the morning, and among the terraces and
flower-beds of the garden. They crossed the fish-pond,
where the carp were leaping as thick as bees; they
mounted, one after another, the various flights of stairs,
snowed upon, as they went, with April blossoms, and
marching in time to the great orchestra of birds. Nor did
Otto pause till they had reached the highest terrace of
the garden. Here was a gate into the park, and hard
by, under a tuft of laurel, a marble garden seat. Hence
they looked down on the green tops of many elm-trees,
where the rooks were busy; and, beyond that, upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72"></a>72</span>
palace roof, and the yellow banner flying in the blue. &ldquo;I
pray you to be seated, sir,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>Sir John complied without a word; and for some
seconds Otto walked to and fro before him, plunged in
angry thought. The birds were all singing for a wager.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Prince at length, turning towards the
Englishman, &ldquo;you are to me, except by the conventions
of society, a perfect stranger. Of your character and
wishes I am ignorant. I have never wittingly disobliged
you. There is a difference in station, which I desire to
waive. I would, if you still think me entitled to so much
consideration&mdash;I would be regarded simply as a gentleman.
Now, sir, I did wrong to glance at these papers,
which I here return to you; but if curiosity be undignified,
as I am free to own, falsehood is both cowardly and
cruel. I opened your roll; and what did I find&mdash;what
did I find about my wife? Lies!&rdquo; he broke out. &ldquo;They
are lies! There are not, so help me God! four words of
truth in your intolerable libel! You are a man; you are
old, and might be the girl&rsquo;s father; you are a gentleman;
you are a scholar, and have learned refinement; and you
rake together all this vulgar scandal, and propose to print
it in a public book! Such is your chivalry! But, thank
God, sir, she has still a husband. You say, sir, in that
paper in your hand, that I am a bad fencer; I have to
request from you a lesson in the art. The park is close
behind; yonder is the Pheasant House, where you will
find your carriage; should I fall, you know, sir&mdash;you have
written it in your paper&mdash;how little my movements are
regarded; I am in the custom of disappearing: it will be
one more disappearance; and long before it has awakened
a remark, you may be safe across the border.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;that what you
ask is impossible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if I struck you?&rdquo; cried the Prince, with a
sudden menacing flash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a cowardly blow,&rdquo; returned the Baronet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73"></a>73</span>
unmoved, &ldquo;for it would make no change. I cannot draw
upon a reigning sovereign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it is this man, to whom you dare not offer satisfaction,
that you choose to insult!&rdquo; cried Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the traveller, &ldquo;you are unjust.
It is because you are a reigning sovereign that I cannot
fight with you; and it is for the same reason that I have
a right to criticise your action and your wife. You are in
everything a public creature; you belong to the public,
body and bone. You have with you the law, the muskets
of the army, and the eyes of spies. We, on our side, have
but one weapon&mdash;truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Truth!&rdquo; echoed the Prince, with a gesture.</p>

<p>There was another silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; said Sir John at last, &ldquo;you must
not expect grapes from a thistle. I am old and a cynic.
Nobody cares a rush for me; and on the whole, after
the present interview, I scarce know anybody that I like
better than yourself. You see, I have changed my mind,
and have the uncommon virtue to avow the change. I
tear up this stuff before you, here in your own garden;
I ask your pardon, I ask the pardon of the Princess;
and I give you my word of honour as a gentleman and
an old man, that when my book of travels shall appear
it shall not contain so much as the name of Gr√ºnewald.
And yet it was a racy chapter! But had your Highness
only read about the other courts! I am a carrion crow;
but it is not my fault, after all, that the world is such a
nauseous kennel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;is the eye not jaundiced?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; cried the traveller, &ldquo;very likely. I am one
who goes sniffing; I am no poet. I believe in a better
future for the world; or, at all accounts, I do most
potently disbelieve in the present. Rotten eggs is the
burthen of my song. But indeed, your Highness, when
I meet with any merit, I do not think that I am slow
to recognise it. This is a day that I shall still recall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74"></a>74</span>
with gratitude, for I have found a sovereign with some
manly virtues; and for once&mdash;old courtier and old radical
as I am&mdash;it is from the heart and quite sincerely that I
can request the honour of kissing your Highness&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, sir,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;to my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the Englishman, taken at unawares, was clasped
for a moment in the Prince&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, sir,&rdquo; added Otto, &ldquo;there is the Pheasant
House; close behind it you will find my carriage, which
I pray you to accept. God speed you to Vienna!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the impetuosity of youth,&rdquo; replied Sir John,
&ldquo;your Highness has overlooked one circumstance: I am
still fasting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said Otto, smiling, &ldquo;you are your own
master; you may go or stay. But I warn you, your
friend may prove less powerful than your enemies. The
Prince, indeed, is thoroughly on your side; he has all
the will to help; but to whom do I speak?&mdash;you know
better than I do, he is not alone in Gr√ºnewald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a deal in position,&rdquo; returned the traveller,
gravely nodding. &ldquo;Gondremark loves to temporise; his
policy is below ground, and he fears all open courses;
and now that I have seen you act with so much spirit,
I will cheerfully risk myself on your protection. Who
knows? You may be yet the better man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you indeed believe so?&rdquo; cried the Prince. &ldquo;You
put life into my heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give up sketching portraits,&rdquo; said the Baronet.
&ldquo;I am a blind owl; I had misread you strangely. And
yet remember this: a sprint is one thing, and to run all
day another. For I still mistrust your constitution; the
short nose, the hair and eyes of several complexions; no,
they are diagnostic; and I must end, I see, as I began.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am still a singing chambermaid?&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, your Highness, I pray you to forget what I
had written,&rdquo; said Sir John; &ldquo;I am not like Pilate; and
the chapter is no more. Bury it, if you love me.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>WHILE THE PRINCE IS IN THE ANTE-ROOM....</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Greatly</span> comforted by the exploits of the morning, the
Prince turned towards the Princess&rsquo;s ante-room, bent on
a more difficult enterprise. The curtains rose before him,
the usher called his name, and he entered the room with
an exaggeration of his usual mincing and airy dignity.
There were about a score of persons waiting, principally
ladies; it was one of the few societies in Gr√ºnewald where
Otto knew himself to be popular; and while a maid of
honour made her exit by a side door to announce his
arrival to the Princess, he moved round the apartment,
collecting homage and bestowing compliments with friendly
grace. Had this been the sum of his duties, he had been
an admirable monarch. Lady after lady was impartially
honoured by his attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said to one, &ldquo;how does this happen?
I find you daily more adorable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your Highness daily browner,&rdquo; replied the lady.
&ldquo;We began equal; oh, there I will be bold: we have
both beautiful complexions. But while I study mine,
your Highness tans himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A perfect negro, madam; and what so fitly&mdash;being
beauty&rsquo;s slave?&rdquo; said Otto.&mdash;&ldquo;Madame Grafinski, when
is our next play? I have just heard that I am a bad
actor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>O ciel!</i>&rdquo; cried Madame Grafinski. &ldquo;Who could
venture? What a bear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;An excellent man, I can assure you,&rdquo; returned
Otto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76"></a>76</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, never! O, is it possible!&rdquo; fluted the lady.
&ldquo;Your Highness plays like an angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be right, madam; who could speak
falsely and yet look so charming?&rdquo; said the Prince.
&ldquo;But this gentleman, it seems, would have preferred
me playing like an actor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A sort of hum, a falsetto, feminine cooing, greeted
the tiny sally; and Otto expanded like a peacock. This
warm atmosphere of women and flattery and idle chatter
pleased him to the marrow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame von Eisenthal, your coiffure is delicious,&rdquo;
he remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everyone was saying so,&rdquo; said one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I have pleased Prince Charming?&rdquo; And Madame
von Eisenthal swept him a deep curtsey with a killing
glance of adoration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is new?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Vienna fashion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mint new,&rdquo; replied the lady, &ldquo;for your Highness&rsquo;s
return. I felt young this morning; it was a premonition.
But why, Prince, do you ever leave us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For the pleasure of the return,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;I am
like a dog; I must bury my bone, and then come back to
gloat upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, a bone! Fie, what a comparison! You have
brought back the manners of the wood,&rdquo; returned the
lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, it is what the dog has dearest,&rdquo; said the
Prince. &ldquo;But I observe Madame von Rosen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Otto, leaving the group to which he had been
piping, stepped towards the embrasure of a window where
a lady stood.</p>

<p>The Countess von Rosen had hitherto been silent,
and a thought depressed, but on the approach of Otto
she began to brighten. She was tall, slim as a nymph,
and of a very airy carriage; and her face, which was
already beautiful in repose, lightened and changed, flashed
into smiles, and glowed with a lovely colour at the touch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77"></a>77</span>
of animation. She was a good vocalist; and, even in
speech, her voice commanded a great range of changes,
the low notes rich with tenor quality, the upper ringing,
on the brink of laughter, into music. A gem of many
facets, and variable hues of fire; a woman who withheld
the better portion of her beauty, and then, in a caressing
second, flashed it like a weapon full on the beholder; now
merely a tall figure and a sallow handsome face, with the
evidences of a reckless temper; anon opening like a
flower to life and colour, mirth and tenderness:&mdash;Madame
von Rosen had always a dagger in reserve for the despatch
of ill-assured admirers. She met Otto with the dart of
tender gaiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have come to me at last, Prince Cruel,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Butterfly! Well, and am I not to kiss your
hand?&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, it is I who must kiss yours.&rdquo; And Otto
bowed and kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You deny me every indulgence,&rdquo; she said, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now what news in court?&rdquo; inquired the Prince.
&ldquo;I come to you for my gazette.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ditch-water!&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;The world is all
asleep, grown grey in slumber; I do not remember any
waking movement since quite an eternity; and the last
thing in the nature of a sensation was the last time my
governess was allowed to box my ears. But yet I do
myself and your unfortunate enchanted palace some injustice.
Here is the last&mdash;O positively!&rdquo; And she told
him the story from behind her fan, with many glances,
many cunning strokes of the narrator&rsquo;s art. The others
had drawn away, for it was understood that Madame
von Rosen was in favour with the Prince. None the
less, however, did the Countess lower her voice at times
to within a semitone of whispering; and the pair leaned
together over the narrative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Otto, laughing, &ldquo;you are the
only entertaining woman on this earth!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78"></a>78</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you have found out so much,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam, I grow wiser with advancing years,&rdquo;
he returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Years!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Do you name the traitors?
I do not believe in years; the calendar is a delusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must be right, madam,&rdquo; replied the Prince.
&ldquo;For six years that we have been good friends, I have
observed you to grow younger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Flatterer,&rdquo; cried she, and then, with a change, &ldquo;But
why should I say so,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;when I protest I think
the same? A week ago I had a council with my father
director, the glass; and the glass replied, &lsquo;Not yet!&rsquo;
I confess my face in this way once a month. O! a very
solemn moment. Do you know what I shall do when
the mirror answers, &lsquo;Now&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot guess,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more can I,&rdquo; returned the Countess. &ldquo;There is
such a choice! Suicide, gambling, a nunnery, a volume
of memoirs, or politics&mdash;the last, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a dull trade,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;it is a trade I rather like. It
is, after all, first cousin to gossip, which no one can deny
to be amusing. For instance, if I were to tell you that
the Princess and the Baron rode out together daily to
inspect the cannon, it is either a piece of politics or
scandal, as I turn my phrase. I am the alchemist that
makes the transmutation. They have been everywhere
together since you left,&rdquo; she continued, brightening as
she saw Otto darken; &ldquo;that is a poor snippet of malicious
gossip&mdash;and they were everywhere cheered&mdash;and with
that addition all becomes political intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us change the subject,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was about to propose it,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;or rather
to pursue the politics. Do you know? this war is popular&mdash;popular
to the length of cheering Princess Seraphina.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All things, madam, are possible,&rdquo; said the Prince;
&ldquo;and this among others, that we may be going into war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79"></a>79</span>
but I give you my word of honour I do not know with
whom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you put up with it?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I have no
pretensions to morality; and I confess I have always
abominated the lamb, and nourished a romantic feeling
for the wolf. O, be done with lambiness! Let us see
there is a prince, for I am weary of the distaff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;I thought you were of that
faction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be of yours, <i>mon Prince</i>, if you had one,&rdquo;
she retorted. &ldquo;Is it true that you have no ambition?
There was a man once in England whom they call the
kingmaker. Do you know,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I fancy I could
make a prince?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day, madam,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;I may ask you to
help make a farmer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that a riddle?&rdquo; asked the Countess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the Prince, &ldquo;and a very good one
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tit for tat. I will ask you another,&rdquo; she returned.
&ldquo;Where is Gondremark?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prime Minister? In the prime-ministry, no
doubt,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said the Countess; and she pointed with
her fan to the door of the Princess&rsquo;s apartments. &ldquo;You
and I, <i>mon Prince</i>, are in the ante-room. You think
me unkind,&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;Try me and you will see.
Set me a task, put me a question; there is no enormity
I am not capable of doing to oblige you, and no secret
that I am not ready to betray.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam, but I respect my friend too much,&rdquo;
he answered, kissing her hand. &ldquo;I would rather remain
ignorant of all. We fraternise like foemen soldiers at
the outposts, but let each be true to his own army.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;if all men were generous like you,
it would be worth while to be a woman!&rdquo; Yet, judging
by her looks, his generosity, if anything, had disappointed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80"></a>80</span>
her; she seemed to seek a remedy, and, having found
it, brightened once more. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;may
I dismiss my sovereign? This is rebellion and a <i>cas
pendable</i>; but what am I to do? My bear is jealous!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, enough!&rdquo; cried Otto. &ldquo;Ahasuerus reaches
you the sceptre; more, he will obey you in all points.
I should have been a dog to come to whistling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And so the Prince departed, and fluttered round
Grafinski and von Eisenthal. But the Countess knew
the use of her offensive weapons, and had left a pleasant
arrow in the Prince&rsquo;s heart. That Gondremark was
jealous&mdash;here was an agreeable revenge! And Madame
von Rosen, as the occasion of the jealousy, appeared to
him in a new light.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page81"></a>81</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>... GONDREMARK IS IN MY LADY&rsquo;S CHAMBER</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Countess von Rosen spoke the truth. The great
Prime Minister of Gr√ºnewald was already closeted with
Seraphina. The toilet was over; and the Princess, tastefully
arrayed, sat face to face with a tall mirror. Sir
John&rsquo;s description was unkindly true, true in terms and
yet a libel, a misogynistic masterpiece. Her forehead
was perhaps too high, but it became her; her figure somewhat
stooped, but every detail was formed and finished
like a gem; her hand, her foot, her ear, the set of her
comely head, were all dainty and accordant; if she was
not beautiful, she was vivid, changeful, coloured, and
pretty with a thousand various prettinesses; and her
eyes, if they indeed rolled too consciously, yet rolled to
purpose. They were her most attractive feature, yet
they continually bore eloquent false witness to her
thoughts; for while she herself, in the depths of her immature,
unsoftened heart, was given altogether to man-like
ambition and the desire of power, the eyes were by
turns bold, inviting, fiery, melting, and artful, like the
eyes of a rapacious siren. And artful, in a sense, she
was. Chafing that she was not a man, and could not shine
by action, she had, conceived a woman&rsquo;s part, of answerable
domination; she sought to subjugate for by-ends,
to rain influence and be fancy free; and, while she loved
not man, loved to see man obey her. It is a common
girl&rsquo;s ambition. Such was perhaps that lady of the glove,
who sent her lover to the lions. But the snare is laid alike
for male and female, and the world most artfully contrived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page82"></a>82</span></p>

<p>Near her, in a low chair, Gondremark had arranged
his limbs into a cat-like attitude, high-shouldered, stooping,
and submiss. The formidable blue jowl of the man,
and the dull bilious eye, set perhaps a higher value on
his evident desire to please. His face was marked by
capacity, temper, and a kind of bold, piratical dishonesty
which it would be calumnious to call deceit. His manners,
as he smiled upon the Princess, were over-fine, yet
hardly elegant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said the Baron, &ldquo;I should now proceed
to take my leave. I must not keep my sovereign in the
ante-room. Let us come at once to a decision.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot, cannot be put off?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; answered Gondremark. &ldquo;Your
Highness sees it for herself. In the earlier stages we
might imitate the serpent; but for the ultimatum, there
is no choice but to be bold like lions. Had the Prince
chosen to remain away, it had been better; but we have
gone too far forward to delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What can have brought him?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;To-day
of all days?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The marplot, madam, has the instinct of his nature,&rdquo;
returned Gondremark. &ldquo;But you exaggerate the peril.
Think, madam, how far we have prospered, and against
what odds! Shall a Featherhead?&mdash;but no!&rdquo; And he
blew upon his fingers lightly with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Featherhead,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;is still the Prince of
Gr√ºnewald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On your sufferance only, and so long as you shall
please to be indulgent,&rdquo; said the Baron. &ldquo;There are
rights of nature; power to the powerful is the law. If
he shall think to cross your destiny&mdash;well, you have heard
of the brazen and the earthen pot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you call me pot? You are ungallant, Baron,&rdquo;
laughed the Princess.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before we are done with your glory, I shall have
called you by many different titles,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page83"></a>83</span></p>

<p>The girl flushed with pleasure. &ldquo;But Fr√©d√©ric is still
the Prince, <i>monsieur le flatteur</i>,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You do
not propose a revolution?&mdash;you of all men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear madam, when it is already made!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;The Prince reigns indeed in the almanac; but my
Princess reigns and rules.&rdquo; And he looked at her with
a fond admiration that made the heart of Seraphina
swell. Looking on her huge slave, she drank the intoxicating
joys of power. Meanwhile he continued, with that
sort of massive archness that so ill became him, &ldquo;She has
but one fault; there is but one danger in the great career
that I foresee for her. May I name it? may I be so
irreverent? It is in herself&mdash;her heart is soft.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her courage is faint, Baron,&rdquo; said the Princess.
&ldquo;Suppose we have judged ill, suppose we were defeated?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Defeated, madam?&rdquo; returned the Baron, with a
touch of ill-humour. &ldquo;Is the dog defeated by the hare?
Our troops are all cantoned along the frontier; in five
hours the vanguard of five thousand bayonets shall be
hammering on the gates of Brandenau; and in all Gerolstein
there are not fifteen hundred men who can man&oelig;uvre.
It is as simple as a sum. There can be no resistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is no great exploit,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Is that what
you call glory? It is like beating a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The courage, madam, is diplomatic,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;We take a grave step; we fix the eyes of Europe,
for the first time, on Gr√ºnewald; and in the negotiations
of the next three months, mark me, we stand or fall.
It is there, madam, that I shall have to depend upon your
counsels,&rdquo; he added, almost gloomily. &ldquo;If I had not
seen you at work, if I did not know the fertility of your
mind, I own I should tremble for the consequence. But
It is in this field that men must recognise their inability.
All the great negotiators, when they have not been women,
have had women at their elbows. Madame de Pompadour
was ill served; she had not found her Gondremark;
but what a mighty politician! Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84"></a>84</span>
what justice of sight, what readiness of means, what elasticity
against defeat! But alas! madam, her Featherheads
were her own children; and she had that one touch
of vulgarity, that one trait of the good-wife, that she
suffered family ties and affections to confine her liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These singular views of history, strictly <i>ad usum
Seraphin√¶</i>, did not weave their usual soothing spell over
the Princess. It was plain that she had taken a momentary
distaste to her own resolutions; for she continued
to oppose her counsellor, looking upon him out of half-closed
eyes and with the shadow of a sneer upon her lips.
&ldquo;What boys men are!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;what lovers of big
words! Courage, indeed! If you had to scour pans,
Herr von Gondremark, you would call it, I suppose,
Domestic Courage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would, madam,&rdquo; said the Baron stoutly, &ldquo;if I
scoured them well. I would put a good name upon a
virtue; you will not overdo it; they are not so enchanting
in themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but let me see,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wish to understand
your courage. Why we asked leave, like children!
Our grannie in Berlin, our uncle in Vienna, the whole
family, have patted us on the head and sent us forward.
Courage? I wonder when I hear you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Princess is unlike herself,&rdquo; returned the Baron.
&ldquo;She has forgotten where the peril lies. True, we have
received encouragement on every hand; but my Princess
knows too well on what untenable conditions; and she
knows besides how, in the publicity of the diet, these
whispered conferences are forgotten and disowned. The
danger is very real&rdquo;&mdash;he raged inwardly at having to
blow the very coal he had been quenching&mdash;&ldquo;none the
less real in that it is not precisely military, but for that
reason the easier to be faced. Had we to count upon
your troops, although I share your Highness&rsquo;s expectations
of the conduct of Alvenau, we cannot forget that
he has not been proved in chief command. But where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85"></a>85</span>
negotiation is concerned, the conduct lies with us; and
with your help, I laugh at danger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be so,&rdquo; said Seraphina, sighing. &ldquo;It is elsewhere
that I see danger. The people, these abominable
people&mdash;suppose they should instantly rebel? What a
figure we should make in the eyes of Europe to have
undertaken an invasion while my own throne was tottering
to its fall!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; said Gondremark, smiling, &ldquo;here you
are beneath yourself. What is it that feeds their discontent?
What but the taxes? Once we have seized
Gerolstein, the taxes are remitted, the sons return covered
with renown, the houses are adorned with pillage, each
tastes his little share of military glory, and behold us once
again a happy family! &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; they will say in each other&rsquo;s
long ears, &lsquo;the Princess knew what she was about; she
was in the right of it; she has a head upon her shoulders;
and here we are, you see, better off than before.&rsquo; But why
should I say all this? It is what my Princess pointed
out to me herself; it was by these reasons that she converted
me to this adventure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; said Seraphina,
somewhat tartly, &ldquo;you often attribute your own sagacity
to your Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a second Gondremark staggered under the shrewdness
of the attack; the next, he had perfectly recovered.
&ldquo;Do I?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is very possible. I have observed
a similar tendency in your Highness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was so openly spoken, and appeared so just, that
Seraphina breathed again. Her vanity had been alarmed,
and the greatness of the relief improved her spirits.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;all this is little to the purpose. We
are keeping Fr√©d√©ric without, and I am still ignorant of
our line of battle. Come, co-admiral, let us consult....
How am I to receive him now? And what are we to
do if he should appear at the council?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I shall leave him to my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86"></a>86</span>
Princess for just now! I have seen her at work. Send
him off to his theatricals! But in all gentleness,&rdquo; he
added. &ldquo;Would it, for instance, would it displease my
sovereign to affect a headache?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;The woman who can manage,
like the man who can fight, must never shrink from an
encounter. The knight must not disgrace his weapons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let me pray my <i>belle dame sans merci</i>,&rdquo; he returned,
&ldquo;to affect the only virtue that she lacks. Be
pitiful to the poor young man; affect an interest in his
hunting; be weary of politics; find in his society, as it
were, a grateful repose from dry considerations. Does my
Princess authorise the line of battle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that is a trifle,&rdquo; answered Seraphina.  &ldquo;The
council&mdash;there is the point.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The council?&rdquo; cried Gondremark.  &ldquo;Permit me,
madam.&rdquo;  And he rose and proceeded to flutter about
the room, counterfeiting Otto both in voice and gesture
not unhappily. &ldquo;What is there to-day, Herr von Gondremark?
Ah, Herr Cancellarius, a new wig! You cannot
deceive me; I know every wig in Gr√ºnewald; I have
the sovereign&rsquo;s eye. What are these papers about? O,
I see. O, certainly. Surely, surely. I wager none of
you remarked that wig. By all means. I know nothing
about that. Dear me, are there as many as all that?
Well, you can sign them; you have the procuration. You
see, Herr Cancellarius, I knew your wig. And so,&rdquo; concluded
Gondremark, resuming his own voice, &ldquo;our
sovereign, by the particular grace of God, enlightens and
supports his privy councillors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But when the Baron turned to Seraphina for approval
he found her frozen. &ldquo;You are pleased to be witty, Herr
von Gondremark,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and have perhaps forgotten
where you are. But these rehearsals are apt to be
misleading. Your master, the Prince of Gr√ºnewald, is
sometimes more exacting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gondremark cursed her in his soul. Of all injured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87"></a>87</span>
vanities, that of the reproved buffoon is the most savage;
and when grave issues are involved, these petty stabs
become unbearable. But Gondremark was a man of
iron; he showed nothing; he did not even, like the
common trickster, retreat because he had presumed, but
held to his point bravely. &ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if, as
you say, he prove exacting, we must take the bull by the
horns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; she said, and she arranged her skirt
like one about to rise. Temper, scorn, disgust, all the
more acrid feelings, became her like jewels; and she now
looked her best.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray God they quarrel,&rdquo; thought Gondremark.
&ldquo;The damned minx may fail me yet, unless they quarrel.
It is time to let him in. Zz&mdash;fight, dogs!&rdquo; Consequent
on these reflections, he bent a stiff knee, and chivalrously
kissed the Princess&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;My Princess,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;must now dismiss her servant. I have much to arrange
against the hour of council.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go,&rdquo; she said, and rose.</p>

<p>And as Gondremark tripped out of a private door,
she touched a bell, and gave the order to admit the
Prince.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>THE PRINCE DELIVERS A LECTURE ON MARRIAGE,
WITH PRACTICAL ILLUSTRATIONS OF DIVORCE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">With</span> what a world of excellent intentions Otto entered
his wife&rsquo;s cabinet! how fatherly, how tender! how morally
affecting were the words he had prepared! Nor
was Seraphina unamiably inclined. Her usual fear of
Otto as a marplot in her great designs was now swallowed
up in a passing distrust of the designs themselves.
For Gondremark, besides, she had conceived an angry
horror. In her heart she did not like the Baron. Behind
his impudent servility, behind the devotion which, with
indelicate delicacy, he still forced on her attention, she
divined the grossness of his nature. So a man may be
proud of having tamed a bear, and yet sicken at his captive&rsquo;s
odour. And above all, she had certain jealous intimations
that the man was false and the deception double.
True, she falsely trifled with his love; but he, perhaps,
was only trifling with her vanity. The insolence of his
late mimicry, and the odium of her own position as she
sat and watched it, lay besides like a load upon her conscience.
She met Otto almost with a sense of guilt, and
yet she welcomed him as a deliverer from ugly things.</p>

<p>But the wheels of an interview are at the mercy of a
thousand ruts; and even at Otto&rsquo;s entrance, the first
jolt occurred. Gondremark, he saw, was gone; but
there was the chair drawn close for consultation; and it
pained him not only that this man had been received,
but that he should depart with such an air of secrecy.
Struggling with this twinge, it was somewhat sharply
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89"></a>89</span>
that he dismissed the attendant who had brought
him in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You make yourself at home, <i>chez moi</i>,&rdquo; she said, a
little ruffled both by his tone of command and by the
glance he had thrown upon the chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Otto, &ldquo;I am here so seldom that
I have almost the rights of a stranger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You choose your own associates, Fr√©d√©ric,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am here to speak of it,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;It is now
four years since we were married; and these four years,
Seraphina, have not perhaps been happy either for you
or for me. I am well aware I was unsuitable to be your
husband. I was not young, I had no ambition, I was a
trifler; and you despised me, I dare not say unjustly.
But to do justice on both sides, you must bear in mind
how I have acted. When I found it amused you to play
the part of Princess on this little stage, did I not immediately
resign to you my box of toys, this Gr√ºnewald?
And when I found I was distasteful as a husband, could
any husband have been less intrusive? You will tell me
that I have no feelings, no preference, and thus no credit;
that I go before the wind; that all this was in my character.
And indeed, one thing is true,&mdash;that it is easy, too
easy, to leave things undone. But, Seraphina, I begin
to learn it is not always wise. If I were too old and too
uncongenial for your husband, I should still have remembered
that I was the Prince of that country to which you
came, a visitor and a child. In that relation also there
were duties, and these duties I have not performed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To claim the advantage of superior age is to give sure
offence. &ldquo;Duty!&rdquo; laughed Seraphina, &ldquo;and on your
lips, Fr√©d√©ric! You make me laugh. What fancy is
this? Go, flirt with the maids and be a prince in Dresden
china, as you look. Enjoy yourself, <i>mon enfant</i>, and
leave duty and the state to us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The plural grated on the Prince. &ldquo;I have enjoyed
myself too much,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since enjoyment is the word.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90"></a>90</span>
And yet there were much to say upon the other side.
You must suppose me desperately fond of hunting. But
indeed there were days when I found a great deal of
interest in what it was courtesy to call my government.
And I have always had some claim to taste; I could
tell live happiness from dull routine; and between hunting,
and the throne of Austria, and your society, my choice
had never wavered, had the choice been mine. You were
a girl, a bud, when you were given me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is this to be a love-scene?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am never ridiculous,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it is my only
merit; and you may be certain this shall be a scene of
marriage <i>√† la mode</i>. But when I remember the beginning,
it is bare courtesy to speak in sorrow. Be just,
madam: you would think me strangely uncivil to recall
these days without the decency of a regret. Be yet a
little juster, and own, if only in complaisance, that you
yourself regret that past.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to regret,&rdquo; said the Princess. &ldquo;You
surprise me. I thought you were so happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Happy and happy, there are so many hundred
ways,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;A man may be happy in revolt;
he may be happy in sleep; wine, change, and travel
make him happy; virtue, they say, will do the like&mdash;I
have not tried; and they say also that in old, quiet,
and habitual marriages there is yet another happiness.
Happy, yes; I am happy if you like; but I will tell
you frankly, I was happier when I brought you home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Princess, not without constraint,
&ldquo;it seems you changed your mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; returned Otto, &ldquo;I never changed. Do you
remember, Seraphina, on our way home, when you saw
the roses in the lane, and I got out and plucked them?
It was a narrow lane between great trees; the sunset
at the end was all gold, and the rooks were flying overhead.
There were nine, nine red roses; you gave me a
kiss for each, and I told myself that every rose and every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91"></a>91</span>
kiss should stand for a year of love. Well, in eighteen
months there was an end. But do you fancy, Seraphina,
that my heart has altered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I cannot tell,&rdquo; she said, like an automaton.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has not,&rdquo; the Prince continued. &ldquo;There is
nothing ridiculous, even from a husband, in a love that
owns itself unhappy and that asks no more. I built on
sand; pardon me, I do not breathe a reproach&mdash;I built,
I suppose, upon my own infirmities; but I put my heart
in the building, and it still lies among the ruins.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How very poetical!&rdquo; she said, with a little choking
laugh, unknown relentings, unfamiliar softnesses, moving
within her. &ldquo;What would you be at?&rdquo; she added,
hardening her voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would be at this,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and hard it is
to say. I would be at this:&mdash;Seraphina, I am your
husband, after all, and a poor fool that loves you. Understand,&rdquo;
he cried almost fiercely, &ldquo;I am no suppliant
husband; what your love refuses I would scorn to receive
from your pity. I do not ask, I would not take it. And
for jealousy, what ground have I? A dog-in-the-manger
jealousy is a thing the dogs may laugh at. But at least,
in the world&rsquo;s eye, I am still your husband; and I ask
you if you treat me fairly? I keep to myself, I leave you
free, I have given you in everything your will. What do
you in return? I find, Seraphina, that you have been
too thoughtless. But between persons such as we are, in
our conspicuous station, particular care and a particular
courtesy are owing. Scandal is perhaps not easy to
avoid; but it is hard to bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scandal!&rdquo; she cried, with a deep breath. &ldquo;Scandal!
It is for this you have been driving!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have tried to tell you how I feel,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I
have told you that I love you&mdash;love you in vain&mdash;a bitter
thing for a husband; I have laid myself open that I
might speak without offence. And now that I have begun,
I will go on and finish.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"></a>92</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I demand it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;What is this about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto flushed crimson. &ldquo;I have to say what I would
fain not,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I counsel you to see less of
Gondremark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of Gondremark? And why?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your intimacy is the ground of scandal, madam,&rdquo;
said Otto, firmly enough&mdash;&ldquo;of a scandal that is agony
to me, and would be crushing to your parents if they
knew it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are the first to bring me word of it,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;I thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have perhaps cause,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Perhaps I
am the only one among your friends&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, leave my friends alone,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;My
friends are of a different stamp. You have come to me
here and made a parade of sentiment. When have I
last seen you? I have governed your kingdom for you
in the meantime, and there I got no help. At last,
when I am weary with a man&rsquo;s work, and you are
weary of your playthings, you return to make me a
scene of conjugal reproaches&mdash;the grocer and his wife!
The positions are too much reversed; and you should
understand, at least, that I cannot at the same time do
your work of government and behave myself like a
little girl. Scandal is the atmosphere in which we live,
we princes; it is what a prince should know. You play
an odious part. Do you believe this rumour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, should I be here?&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I want to know!&rdquo; she cried, the tempest
of her scorn increasing. &ldquo;Suppose you did&mdash;I say, suppose
you did believe it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should make it my business to suppose the contrary,&rdquo;
he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought so. O, you are made of baseness!&rdquo; said
she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he cried, roused at last, &ldquo;enough of this.
You wilfully misunderstand my attitude; you outwear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93"></a>93</span>
my patience. In the name of your parents, in my own
name, I summon you to be more circumspect.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this a request, <i>monsieur mon mari</i>?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, if I chose, I might command,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might, sir, as the law stands, make me prisoner,&rdquo;
returned Seraphina. &ldquo;Short of that you will
gain nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will continue as before?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely as before,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;As soon as this
comedy is over, I shall request the Freiherr von Gondremark
to visit me. Do you understand?&rdquo; she added,
rising. &ldquo;For my part, I have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will then ask the favour of your hand, madam,&rdquo;
said Otto, palpitating in every pulse with anger. &ldquo;I
have to request that you will visit in my society another
part of my poor house. And reassure yourself&mdash;it will
not take long&mdash;and it is the last obligation that you shall
have the chance to lay me under.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The last?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Most joyfully!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She offered her hand, and he took it; on each side
with an elaborate affectation, each inwardly incandescent.
He led her out by the private door, following where Gondremark
had passed; they threaded a corridor or two,
little frequented, looking on a court, until they came at
last into the Prince&rsquo;s suite. The first room was an armoury,
hung all about with the weapons of various countries, and
looking forth on the front terrace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you brought me here to slay me?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have brought you, madam, only to pass on,&rdquo; replied
Otto.</p>

<p>Next they came to a library, where an old chamberlain
sat half asleep. He rose and bowed before the
princely couple, asking for orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will attend us here,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>The next stage was a gallery of pictures, where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94"></a>94</span>
Seraphina&rsquo;s portrait hung conspicuous, dressed for the
chase, red roses in her hair, as Otto, in the first months
of marriage, had directed. He pointed to it without
a word; she raised her eyebrows in silence; and they
passed still forward into a matted corridor where four
doors opened. One led to Otto&rsquo;s bedroom; one was the
private door to Seraphina&rsquo;s. And here, for the first time,
Otto left her hand, and, stepping forward, shot the bolt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is long, madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since it was bolted on
the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One was effectual,&rdquo; returned the Princess. &ldquo;Is this
all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I reconduct you?&rdquo; he asked, bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should prefer,&rdquo; she asked, in ringing tones, &ldquo;the
conduct of the Freiherr von Gondremark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto summoned the chamberlain. &ldquo;If the Freiherr
von Gondremark is in the palace,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;bid him
attend the Princess here.&rdquo; And when the official had
departed, &ldquo;Can I do more to serve you, madam?&rdquo; the
Prince asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, no. I have been much amused,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have now,&rdquo; continued Otto, &ldquo;given you your
liberty complete. This has been for you a miserable
marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miserable!&rdquo; said she.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has been made light to you; it shall be lighter
still,&rdquo; continued the Prince. &ldquo;But one thing, madam,
you must still continue to bear&mdash;my father&rsquo;s name, which
is now yours. I leave it in your hands. Let me see
you, since you will have no advice of mine, apply the
more attention of your own to bear it worthily.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr von Gondremark is long in coming,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Seraphina, Seraphina!&rdquo; he cried. And that was
the end of their interview.</p>

<p>She tripped to a window and looked out; and a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95"></a>95</span>
after, the chamberlain announced the Freiherr von Gondremark,
who entered with something of a wild eye and
changed complexion, confounded, as he was, at this unusual
summons. The Princess faced round from the
window with a pearly smile; nothing but her heightened
colour spoke of discomposure. Otto was pale, but he
was otherwise master of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;oblige me so far:
reconduct the Princess to her own apartment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Baron, still all at sea, offered his hand, which was
smilingly accepted, and the pair sailed forth through the
picture-gallery.</p>

<p>As soon as they were gone, and Otto knew the length
and breadth of his miscarriage, and how he had done
the contrary of all that he intended, he stood stupefied.
A fiasco so complete and sweeping was laughable, even
to himself; and he laughed aloud in his wrath. Upon
this mood there followed the sharpest violence of remorse;
and to that again, as he recalled his provocation, anger
succeeded afresh. So he was tossed in spirit; now bewailing
his inconsequence and lack of temper, now flaming up
in white-hot indignation and a noble pity for himself.</p>

<p>He paced his apartment like a leopard. There was
danger in Otto, for a flash. Like a pistol, he could kill
at one moment, and the next he might be kicked aside.
But just then, as he walked the long floors in his alternate
humours, tearing his handkerchief between his hands,
he was strung to his top note, every nerve attent. The
pistol, you might say, was charged. And when jealousy
from time to time fetched him a lash across the tenderest
of his feeling, and sent a string of her fire-pictures glancing
before his mind&rsquo;s eye, the contraction of his face
was even dangerous. He disregarded jealousy&rsquo;s inventions,
yet they stung. In this height of anger, he still
preserved his faith in Seraphina&rsquo;s innocence; but the
thought of her possible misconduct was the bitterest
ingredient in his pot of sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96"></a>96</span></p>

<p>There came a knock at the door, and the chamberlain
brought him a note. He took it and ground it in his hand,
continuing his march, continuing his bewildered thoughts;
and some minutes had gone by before the circumstance
came clearly to his mind. Then he paused and opened it.
It was a pencil scratch from Gotthold, thus conceived:</p>

<p class="center f80">&ldquo;The council is privately summoned at once.</p>

<p class="rt f80">&ldquo;G. v. H.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If the council was thus called before the hour, and
that privately, it was plain they feared his interference.
Feared: here was a sweet thought. Gotthold, too&mdash;Gotthold,
who had always used and regarded him as a
mere peasant lad, had now been at the pains to warn
him; Gotthold looked for something at his hands. Well,
none should be disappointed; the Prince, too long beshadowed
by the uxorious lover, should now return and
shine. He summoned his valet, repaired the disorder
of his appearance with elaborate care; and then, curled
and scented and adorned, Prince Charming in every line,
but with a twitching nostril, he set forth unattended for
the council.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>THE PRINCE DISSOLVES THE COUNCIL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was as Gotthold wrote. The liberation of Sir John,
Greisengesang&rsquo;s uneasy narrative, last of all, the scene
between Seraphina and the Prince, had decided the conspirators
to take a step of bold timidity. There had
been a period of bustle, liveried messengers speeding
here and there with notes; and at half-past ten in the
morning, about an hour before its usual hour, the council
of Gr√ºnewald sat around the board.</p>

<p>It was not a large body. At the instance of Gondremark,
it had undergone a strict purgation, and was now
composed exclusively of tools. Three secretaries sat
at a side-table. Seraphina took the head; on her right
was the Baron, on her left Greisengesang; below these
Grafinski the treasurer, Count Eisenthal, a couple of non-combatants,
and, to the surprise of all, Gotthold. He
had been named a privy councillor by Otto, merely
that he might profit by the salary; and as he was never
known to attend a meeting, it had occurred to nobody
to cancel his appointment. His present appearance was
the more ominous, coming when it did. Gondremark
scowled upon him; and the non-combatant on his right,
intercepting this black look, edged away from one who
was so clearly out of favour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The hour presses, your Highness,&rdquo; said the Baron;
&ldquo;may we proceed to business?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At once,&rdquo; replied Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness will pardon me,&rdquo; said Gotthold;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98"></a>98</span>
&ldquo;but you are still, perhaps, unacquainted with the fact
that Prince Otto has returned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Prince will not attend the council,&rdquo; replied
Seraphina, with a momentary blush.&mdash;&ldquo;The despatches,
Herr Cancellarius? There is one for Gerolstein?&rdquo;</p>

<p>A secretary brought a paper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, madam,&rdquo; said Greisengesang. &ldquo;Shall I read
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are all familiar with its terms,&rdquo; replied Gondremark.
&ldquo;Your Highness approves?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unhesitatingly,&rdquo; said Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may then be held as read,&rdquo; concluded the Baron.
&ldquo;Will your Highness sign?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess did so; Gondremark, Eisenthal, and one
of the non-combatants followed suit; and the paper was
then passed across the table to the librarian. He proceeded
leisurely to read.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have no time to spare, Herr Doctor,&rdquo; cried the
Baron brutally. &ldquo;If you do not choose to sign on the
authority of your sovereign, pass it on. Or you may
leave the table,&rdquo; he added, his temper ripping out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I decline your invitation, Herr von Gondremark;
and my sovereign, as I continue to observe with regret,
is still absent from the board,&rdquo; replied the Doctor calmly;
and he resumed the perusal of the paper, the rest chafing
and exchanging glances. &ldquo;Madam and gentlemen,&rdquo;
he said at last, &ldquo;what I hold in my hand is simply a
declaration of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Simply,&rdquo; said Seraphina, flashing defiance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The sovereign of this country is under the same roof
with us,&rdquo; continued Gotthold, &ldquo;and I insist he shall be
summoned. It is needless to adduce my reasons; you
are all ashamed at heart of this projected treachery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The council waved like a sea. There were various
outcries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You insult the Princess,&rdquo; thundered Gondremark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I maintain my protest,&rdquo; replied Gotthold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"></a>99</span></p>

<p>At the height of this confusion the door was thrown
open; an usher announced, &ldquo;Gentlemen, the Prince!&rdquo;
and Otto, with his most excellent bearing, entered the
apartment. It was like oil upon the troubled waters;
every one settled instantly into his place, and <span class="correction" title="originally printed as Griesengesang">Greisengesang</span>,
to give himself a countenance, became absorbed
in the arrangement of his papers; but in their eagerness
to dissemble one and all neglected to rise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Prince, pausing.</p>

<p>They all got to their feet in a moment; and this reproof
still further demoralised the weaker brethren.</p>

<p>The Prince moved slowly towards the lower end of the
table; then he paused again, and, fixing his eye on Greisengesang,
&ldquo;How comes it, Herr Cancellarius,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that I have received no notice of the change of hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; replied the Chancellor, &ldquo;her Highness
the Princess ...&rdquo; and there paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I understood,&rdquo; said Seraphina, taking him up, &ldquo;that
you did not purpose to be present.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their eyes met for a second, and Seraphina&rsquo;s fell;
but her anger only burned the brighter for that private
shame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Otto, taking his chair,
&ldquo;I pray you to be seated. I have been absent; there
are doubtless some arrears; but ere we proceed to business,
Herr Grafinski, you will direct four thousand crowns to be
sent to me at once. Make a note, if you please,&rdquo; he added,
as the treasurer still stared in wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Four thousand crowns?&rdquo; asked Seraphina. &ldquo;Pray
for what?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; returned Otto, smiling, &ldquo;for my own purposes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gondremark spurred up Grafinski underneath the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your Highness will indicate the destination ...&rdquo;
began the puppet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not here, sir, to interrogate your Prince,&rdquo;
said Otto.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page100"></a>100</span></p>

<p>Grafinski looked for help to his commander; and
Gondrermark came to his aid, in suave and measured
tones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness may reasonably be surprised,&rdquo; he
said; &ldquo;and Herr Grafinski, although I am convinced he
is clear of the intention of offending, would have perhaps
done better to begin with an explanation. The resources
of the state are at the present moment entirely swallowed
up, or, as we hope to prove, wisely invested. In a month
from now, I do not question we shall be able to meet
any command your Highness may lay upon us; but
at this hour I fear that, even in so small a matter, he must
prepare himself for disappointment. Our zeal is no less,
although our power may be inadequate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much, Herr Grafinski, have we in the treasury?&rdquo;
asked Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; protested the treasurer, &ldquo;we have
immediate need of every crown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think, sir, you evade me,&rdquo; flashed the Prince; and
then, turning to the side-table, &ldquo;Mr. Secretary,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;bring me, if you please, the treasury docket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Herr Grafinski became deadly pale; the Chancellor,
expecting his own turn, was probably engaged in prayer;
Gondremark was watching like a ponderous cat. Gotthold,
on his part, looked on with wonder at his cousin;
he was certainly showing spirit, but what, in such a time
of gravity, was all this talk of money? and why should he
waste his strength upon a personal issue?</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find,&rdquo; said Otto, with his finger on the docket, &ldquo;that
we have 20,000 crowns in case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is exact, your Highness,&rdquo; replied the Baron.
&ldquo;But our liabilities, all of which are happily not liquid,
amount to a far larger sum; and at the present point
of time it would be morally impossible to divert a single
florin. Essentially, the case is empty. We have, already
presented, a large note for material of war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Material of war?&rdquo; exclaimed Otto, with an excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101"></a>101</span>
assumption of surprise. &ldquo;But if my memory serves me
right, we settled these accounts in January.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There have been further orders,&rdquo; the Baron explained.
&ldquo;A new park of artillery has been completed;
five hundred stand of arms, seven hundred baggage mules&mdash;the
details are in a special memorandum.&mdash;Mr. Secretary
Holtz, the memorandum, if you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;One would think, gentlemen, that we were going
to war,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are,&rdquo; said Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;War!&rdquo; cried the Prince. &ldquo;And, gentlemen, with
whom? The peace of Gr√ºnewald has endured for centuries.
What aggression, what insult, have we suffered?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, your Highness,&rdquo; said Gotthold, &ldquo;is the ultimatum.
It was in the very article of signature, when
your Highness so opportunely entered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto laid the paper before him; as he read, his fingers
played tattoo upon the table. &ldquo;Was it proposed,&rdquo; he
inquired, &ldquo;to send this paper forth without a knowledge
of my pleasure?&rdquo;</p>

<p>One of the non-combatants, eager to trim, volunteered
an answer. &ldquo;The Herr Doctor von Hohenstockwitz had
just entered his dissent,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me the rest of this correspondence,&rdquo; said the
Prince. It was handed to him, and he read it patiently
from end to end, while the councillors sat foolishly enough
looking before them on the table. The secretaries, in the
background, were exchanging glances of delight; a row
at the council was for them a rare and welcome feature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Otto, when he had finished, &ldquo;I
have read with pain. This claim upon Oberm√ºnsterol
is palpably unjust; it has not a tincture, not a show, of
justice. There is not in all this ground enough for after-dinner
talk, and you propose to force it as a <i>casus belli</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, your Highness,&rdquo; returned Gondremark,
too wise to defend the indefensible, &ldquo;the claim on
Oberm√ºnsterol is simply a pretext.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102"></a>102</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;Herr Cancellarius,
take your pen. &lsquo;The council,&rsquo;&rdquo; he began to dictate&mdash;&ldquo;I
withhold all notice of my intervention,&rdquo; he said, in
parenthesis, and addressing himself more directly to his
wife; &ldquo;and I say nothing of the strange suppression by
which this business has been smuggled past my knowledge.
I am content to be in time&mdash;&rsquo;The council,&rsquo;&rdquo;
he resumed, &ldquo;&rsquo;on a further examination of the facts,
and enlightened by the note in the last despatch from
Gerolstein, have the pleasure to announce that they are
entirely at one, both as to fact and sentiment, with the
Grand-Ducal Court of Gerolstein.&rsquo; You have it? Upon
these lines, sir, you will draw up the despatch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your Highness will allow me,&rdquo; said the Baron,
&ldquo;your Highness is so imperfectly acquainted with the
internal history of this correspondence, that any interference
will be merely hurtful. Such a paper as your
Highness proposes would be to stultify the whole previous
policy of Gr√ºnewald.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The policy of Gr√ºnewald!&rdquo; cried the Prince. &ldquo;One
would suppose you had no sense of humour! Would
you fish in a coffee cup?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;With deference, your Highness,&rdquo; returned the Baron,
&ldquo;even in a coffee cup there may be poison. The purpose
of this war is not simply territorial enlargement;
still less is it a war of glory; for, as your Highness indicates,
the state of Gr√ºnewald is too small to be ambitious.
But the body politic is seriously diseased; republicanism,
socialism, many disintegrating ideas are abroad; circle
within circle, a really formidable organisation has grown
up about your Highness&rsquo;s throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have heard of it, Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; put in
the Prince; &ldquo;but I have reason to be aware that yours
is the more authoritative information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am honoured by this expression of my Prince&rsquo;s
confidence,&rdquo; returned Gondremark, unabashed. &ldquo;It is,
therefore, with a single eye to these disorders that our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103"></a>103</span>
present external policy has been shaped. Something was
required to divert public attention, to employ the idle,
to popularise your Highness&rsquo;s rule, and, if it were possible,
to enable him to reduce the taxes at a blow, and to a
notable amount. The proposed expedition&mdash;for it cannot
without hyperbole be called a war&mdash;seemed to the council
to combine the various characters required; a marked
improvement in the public sentiment has followed even
upon our preparations; and I cannot doubt that when
success shall follow, the effect will surpass even our
boldest hopes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are very adroit, Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; said
Otto. &ldquo;You fill me with admiration. I had not heretofore
done justice to your qualities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphina looked up with joy, supposing Otto conquered;
but Gondremark still waited, armed at every
point; he knew how very stubborn is the revolt of a
weak character.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the territorial army scheme, to which I was
persuaded to consent&mdash;was it secretly directed to the
same end?&rdquo; the Prince asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I still believe the effect to have been good,&rdquo; replied
the Baron; &ldquo;discipline and mounting guard are excellent
sedatives. But I will avow to your Highness, I was
unaware, at the date of that decree, of the magnitude
of the revolutionary movement; nor did any of us, I
think, imagine that such a territorial army was a part
of the republican proposals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was?&rdquo; asked Otto. &ldquo;Strange! Upon what
fancied grounds?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The grounds were indeed fanciful,&rdquo; returned the Baron.
&ldquo;It was conceived among the leaders that a territorial
army, drawn from and returning to the people, would,
in the event of any popular uprising, prove lukewarm or
unfaithful to the throne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;I begin to understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Highness begins to understand?&rdquo; repeated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104"></a>104</span>
Gondremark, with the sweetest politeness. &ldquo;May I beg
of him to complete the phrase?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The history of the revolution,&rdquo; replied Otto drily.
&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;what do you conclude?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I conclude, your Highness, with a simple reflection,&rdquo;
said the Baron, accepting the stab without a quiver, &ldquo;the
war is popular; were the rumour contradicted to-morrow,
a considerable disappointment would be felt in many
classes; and in the present tension of spirits, the most
lukewarm sentiment may be enough to precipitate events.
There lies the danger. The revolution hangs imminent;
we sit, at this council board, below the sword of
Damocles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must then lay our heads together,&rdquo; said the
Prince, &ldquo;and devise some honourable means of safety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Up to this moment, since the first note of opposition
fell from the librarian, Seraphina had uttered about twenty
words. With a somewhat heightened colour, her eyes
generally lowered, her foot sometimes nervously tapping
on the floor, she had kept her own counsel and commanded
her anger like a hero. But at this stage of the engagement
she lost control of her impatience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Means!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They have been found and
prepared before you knew the need for them. Sign the
despatch, and let us be done with this delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, I said &lsquo;honourable,&rsquo;&rdquo; returned Otto, bowing.
&ldquo;This war is, in my eyes, and by Herr von Gondremark&rsquo;s
account, an inadmissible expedient. If we have misgoverned
here in Gr√ºnewald, are the people of Gerolstein
to bleed and pay for our misdoings? Never, madam;
not while I live. But I attach so much importance to
all that I have heard to-day for the first time&mdash;and why
only to-day I do not even stop to ask&mdash;that I am eager to
find some plan that I can follow with credit to myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And should you fail?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should I fail, I will then meet the blow half-way,&rdquo;
replied the Prince. &ldquo;On the first open discontent, I shall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105"></a>105</span>
convoke the States, and, when it pleases them to bid me,
abdicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphina laughed angrily. &ldquo;This is the man for whom
we have been labouring!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;We tell him
of change; he will devise the means, he says; and his
device is abdication? Sir, have you no shame to come
here at the eleventh hour among those who have borne
the heat and burthen of the day? Do you not wonder
at yourself? I, sir, was here in my place, striving to uphold
your dignity alone. I took counsel with the wisest I
could find, while you were eating and hunting. I have
laid my plans with foresight; they were ripe for action;
and then&mdash;&rdquo; she choked&mdash;&ldquo;then you return&mdash;for a forenoon&mdash;to
ruin all! To-morrow you will be once more
about your pleasures; you will give us leave once more to
think and work for you; and again you will come back,
and again you will thwart what you had not the industry
or knowledge to conceive. O! it is intolerable. Be
modest, sir. Do not presume upon the rank you cannot
worthily uphold. I would not issue my commands with so
much gusto&mdash;it is from no merit in yourself they are
obeyed. What are you? What have you to do in this
grave council? Go,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;go among your
equals! The very people in the streets mock at you for
a prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this surprising outburst the whole council sat aghast.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the Baron, alarmed out of his caution,
&ldquo;command yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Address yourself to me, sir!&rdquo; cried the Prince. &ldquo;I
will not bear these whisperings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphina burst into tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried the Baron, rising, &ldquo;this lady&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;one more
observation, and I place you under arrest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is the master,&rdquo; replied Gondremark,
bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear it in mind more constantly,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;Herr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106"></a>106</span>
Cancellarius, bring all the papers to my cabinet. Gentlemen,
the council is dissolved.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he bowed and left the apartment, followed by
Greisengesang and the secretaries, just at the moment
when the Princess&rsquo;s ladies, summoned in all haste, entered
by another door to help her forth.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107"></a>107</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>THE PARTY OF WAR TAKES ACTION</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Half</span> an hour after, Gondremark was once more closeted
with Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he now?&rdquo; she asked, on his arrival.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, he is with the Chancellor,&rdquo; replied the Baron.
&ldquo;Wonder of wonders, he is at work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he was born to torture me! O
what a fall, what a humiliation! Such a scheme to wreck
upon so small a trifle! But now all is lost.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Gondremark, &ldquo;nothing is lost. Something,
on the other hand, is found. You have found your
senses; you see him as he is&mdash;see him as you see everything
where your too-good heart is not in question&mdash;with
the judicial, with the statesman&rsquo;s eye. So long as he had
a right to interfere, the empire that may be was still distant.
I have not entered on this course without the plain foresight
of its dangers; and even for this I was prepared.
But, madam, I knew two things; I knew that you were
born to command, that I was born to serve; I knew that
by a rare conjuncture the hand had found the tool; and
from the first I was confident, as I am confident to-day,
that no hereditary trifler has the power to shatter that
alliance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, born to command!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Do you forget
my tears?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, they were the tears of Alexander,&rdquo; cried
the Baron. &ldquo;They touched, they thrilled me; I forgot
myself a moment&mdash;even I! But do you suppose that
I had not remarked, that I had not admired, your previous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"></a>108</span>
bearing? your great self-command? Ay, that was
princely!&rdquo; He paused. &ldquo;It was a thing to see. I
drank confidence! I tried to imitate your calm. And
I was well inspired; in my heart, I think that I was well
inspired; that any man, within the reach of argument,
had been convinced! But it was not to be; nor,
madam, do I regret the failure. Let us be open; let
me disclose my heart. I have loved two things, not unworthily:
Gr√ºnewald and my sovereign!&rdquo; Here he
kissed her hand. &ldquo;Either I must resign my ministry,
leave the land of my adoption and the queen whom I had
chosen to obey&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He paused again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas, Herr von Gondremark, there is no &lsquo;or,&rsquo;&rdquo; said
Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam, give me time,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;When
first I saw you, you were still young; not every man
would have remarked your powers; but I had not been
twice honoured by your conversation ere I had found
my mistress. I have, madam, I believe, some genius;
and I have much ambition. But the genius is of the
serving kind; and to offer a career to my ambition, I
had to find one born to rule. This is the base and essence
of our union; each had need of the other; each recognised,
master and servant, lever and fulcrum, the complement of
his endowment. Marriages, they say, are made in heaven:
how much more these pure, laborious, intellectual fellowships,
born to found empires! Nor is this all. We found
each other ripe, filled with great ideas that took shape
and clarified with every word. We grew together&mdash;ay,
madam, in mind we grew together like twin children.
All of my life until we met was petty and groping; was
it not&mdash;I will flatter myself openly&mdash;it <i>was</i> the same with
you! Not till then had you those eagle surveys, that
wide and hopeful sweep of intuition! Thus we had
formed ourselves, and we were ready.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I feel it. Yours is the genius;
your generosity confounds your insight; all I could offer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109"></a>109</span>
you was the position, was this throne, to be a fulcrum.
But I offered it without reserve; I entered at least warmly
into all your thoughts; you were sure of me&mdash;sure of my
support&mdash;certain of justice. Tell me, tell me again, that
I have helped you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you made me. In everything
you were my inspiration. And as we prepared
our policy, weighing every step, how often have I had
to admire your perspicacity, your man-like diligence and
fortitude! You know that these are not the words of
flattery; your conscience echoes them; have you spared a
day? have you indulged yourself in any pleasure? Young
and beautiful, you have lived a life of high intellectual
effort, of irksome intellectual patience with details. Well,
you have your reward: with the fall of Brandenau the
throne of your Empire is founded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What thought have you in your mind?&rdquo; she asked.
&ldquo;Is not all ruined?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, my Princess, the same thought is in both our
minds,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;by all that I
hold sacred, I have none; I do not think at all; I am
crushed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are looking at the passionate side of a rich nature,
misunderstood and recently insulted,&rdquo; said the Baron.
&ldquo;Look into your intellect, and tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I find nothing, nothing but tumult,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You find one word branded, madam,&rdquo; returned the
Baron: &ldquo;&rsquo;Abdication!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The coward! He leaves me
to bear all, and in the hour of trial he stabs me from
behind. There is nothing in him, not respect, not love,
not courage&mdash;his wife, his dignity, his throne, the honour
of his father, he forgets them all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; pursued the Baron, &ldquo;the word Abdication.
I perceive a glimmering there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I read your fancy,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;It is mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110"></a>110</span>
madness, midsummer madness. Baron, I am more unpopular
than he. You know it. They can excuse, they
can love, his weakness; but me, they hate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is the gratitude of peoples,&rdquo; said the Baron.
&ldquo;But we trifle. Here, madam, are my plain thoughts.
The man who in the hour of danger speaks of abdication
is, for me, a venomous animal. I speak with the bluntness of
gravity, madam; this is no hour for mincing. The coward,
in a station of authority, is more dangerous than fire. We
dwell on a volcano; if this man can have his way, Gr√ºnewald
before a week will have been deluged with innocent
blood. You know the truth of what I say; we have looked
unblenching into this ever-possible catastrophe. To him
it is nothing: he will abdicate! Abdicate, just God!
and this unhappy country committed to his charge, and
the lives of men and the honour of women....&rdquo; His
voice appeared to fail him; in an instant he had conquered
his emotion and resumed: &ldquo;But you, madam, conceive
more worthily of your responsibilities. I am with you in
the thought; and in the face of the horrors that I see
impending, I say, and your heart repeats it&mdash;we have
gone too far to pause. Honour, duty, ay, and the care of
our own lives, demand we should proceed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was looking at him, her brow thoughtfully knitted.
&ldquo;I feel it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But how? He has the power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The power, madam? The power is in the army,&rdquo;
he replied; and then hastily, ere she could intevene, &ldquo;we
have to save ourselves,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I have to save my
Princess, she has to save her minister; we have both of us
to save this infatuated youth from his own madness. He
in the outbreak would be the earliest victim; I see him,&rdquo;
he cried, &ldquo;torn in pieces; and Gr√ºnewald, unhappy
Gr√ºnewald! Nay, madam, you who have the power
must use it; it lies hard upon your conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Show me how!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Suppose I were to
place him under some constraint, the revolution would
break upon us instantly.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page111"></a>111</span></p>

<p>The Baron feigned defeat. &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You
see more clearly than I do. Yet there should, there
must be, some way.&rdquo; And he waited for his chance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I told you from the first there is
no remedy. Our hopes are lost: lost by one miserable
trifler, ignorant, fretful, fitful&mdash;who will have disappeared
to-morrow, who knows? to his boorish pleasures!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Any peg would do for Gondremark. &ldquo;The thing!&rdquo;
he cried, striking his brow. &ldquo;Fool, not to have thought
of it! Madam, without perhaps knowing it, you have
solved our problem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean? Speak!&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>He appeared to collect himself, and then, with a
smile, &ldquo;The Prince,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;must go once more a-hunting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, if he would!&rdquo; cried she, &ldquo;and stay there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And stay there,&rdquo; echoed the Baron. It was so
significantly said, that her face changed; and the schemer,
fearful of the sinister ambiguity of his expressions, hastened
to explain. &ldquo;This time he shall go hunting in a
carriage, with a good escort of our foreign lancers. His
destination shall be the Felsenburg; it is healthy, the
rock is high, the windows are small and barred; it might
have been built on purpose. We shall entrust the captaincy
to the Scotsman Gordon; he at least will have
no scruple. Who will miss the sovereign? He is gone
hunting; he came home on Tuesday, on Thursday he
returned; all is usual in that. Meanwhile the war proceeds;
our Prince will soon weary of his solitude; and
about the time of our triumph, or, if he prove very obstinate,
a little later, he shall be released upon a proper
understanding, and I see him once more directing his
theatricals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphina sat gloomy, plunged in thought. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
she said suddenly, &ldquo;and the despatch? He is now
writing it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It cannot pass the council before Friday,&rdquo; replied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112"></a>112</span>
Gondremark; &ldquo;and as for any private note, the messengers
are all at my disposal. They are picked men,
madam. I am a person of precaution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would appear so,&rdquo; she said, with a flash of her
occasional repugnance to the man; and then after a
pause, &ldquo;Herr von Gondremark,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;I recoil
from this extremity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I share your Highness&rsquo;s repugnance,&rdquo; answered he.
&ldquo;But what would you have? We are defenceless else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it, but this is sudden. It is a public crime,&rdquo;
she said, nodding at him with a sort of horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look but a little deeper,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;and whose
is the crime?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;His, before God! And I hold
him liable. But still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not as if he would be harmed,&rdquo; submitted
Gondremark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; she replied, but it was still unheartily.</p>

<p>And then, as brave men are entitled, by prescriptive
right as old as the world&rsquo;s history, to the alliance and
the active help of Fortune, the punctual goddess stepped
down from the machine. One of the Princess&rsquo;s ladies
begged to enter; a man, it appeared, had brought a line
for the Freiherr von Gondremark. It proved to be a
pencil billet, which the crafty Greisengesang had found
the means to scribble and despatch under the very guns
of Otto; and the daring of the act bore testimony to
the terror of the actor. For Greisengesang had but one
influential motive: fear. The note ran thus: &ldquo;At the
first council, procuration to be withdrawn.&mdash;<span class="sc">Corn. Greis</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So, after three years of exercise, the right of signature
was to be stript from Seraphina. It was more than an
insult; it was a public disgrace; and she did not pause
to consider how she had earned it, but morally bounded
under the attack as bounds the wounded tiger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I will sign the order. When
shall he leave?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page113"></a>113</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It will take me twelve hours to collect my men, and
it had best be done at night. To-morrow midnight, if
you please?&rdquo; answered the Baron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;My door is always open to
you, Baron. As soon as the order is prepared, bring it
me to sign.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;alone of all of us you do not
risk your head in this adventure. For that reason, and
to prevent all hesitation, I venture to propose the order
should be in your hand throughout.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>He laid a form before her, and she wrote the order in
a clear hand, and re-read it. Suddenly a cruel smile came
on her face. &ldquo;I had forgotten his puppet,&rdquo; said she.
&ldquo;They will keep each other company.&rdquo; And she interlined
and initialled the condemnation of Dr. Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness has more memory than your servant,&rdquo;
said the Baron; and then he, in his turn, carefully
perused the fateful paper. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will appear in the drawing-room, Baron?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it better,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to avoid the possibility
of a public affront. Anything that shook my
credit might hamper us in the immediate future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she said; and she held out her hand
as to an old friend and equal.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>THE PRICE OF THE RIVER FARM; IN WHICH
VAIN-GLORY GOES BEFORE A FALL</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> pistol had been practically fired. Under ordinary
circumstances the scene at the council table would have
entirely exhausted Otto&rsquo;s store both of energy and anger;
he would have begun to examine and condemn his conduct,
have remembered all that was true, forgotten all
that was unjust in Seraphina&rsquo;s onslaught; and by half
an hour after would have fallen into that state of mind
in which a Catholic flees to the confessional and a sot
takes refuge with the bottle. Two matters of detail
preserved his spirits. For, first, he had still an infinity
of business to transact; and to transact business, for a
man of Otto&rsquo;s neglectful and procrastinating habits, is the
best anodyne for conscience. All afternoon he was hard
at it with the Chancellor, reading, dictating, signing, and
despatching papers; and this kept him in a glow of self-approval.
But, secondly, his vanity was still alarmed;
he had failed to get the money; to-morrow before noon
he would have to disappoint old Killian; and in the eyes
of that family which counted him so little, and to which
he had sought to play the part of the heroic comforter,
he must sink lower than at first. To a man of Otto&rsquo;s
temper, this was death. He could not accept the situation.
And even as he worked, and worked wisely and
well, over the hated details of his principality, he was
secretly maturing a plan by which to turn the situation.
It was a scheme as pleasing to the man as it was dishonourable
in the prince; in which his frivolous nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115"></a>115</span>
found and took vengeance for the gravity and burthen
of the afternoon. He chuckled as he thought of it: and
Greisengesang heard him with wonder, and attributed
his lively spirits to the skirmish of the morning.</p>

<p>Led by this idea, the antique courtier ventured to
compliment his sovereign on his bearing. It reminded
him, he said, of Otto&rsquo;s father.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the Prince, whose thoughts were
miles away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&rsquo;s authority at the board,&rdquo; explained
the flatterer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that! O, yes,&rdquo; returned Otto; but for all his
carelessness, his vanity was delicately tickled, and his
mind returned and dwelt approvingly over the details
of his victory. &ldquo;I quelled them all,&rdquo; he thought.</p>

<p>When the more pressing matters had been dismissed,
it was already late, and Otto kept the Chancellor to dinner,
and was entertained with a leash of ancient histories
and modern compliments. The Chancellor&rsquo;s career had
been based, from the first off-put, on entire subserviency;
he had crawled into honours and employments; and his
mind was prostitute. The instinct of the creature served
him well with Otto. First, he let fall a sneering word or
two upon the female intellect; thence he proceeded to a
closer engagement; and before the third course he was
artfully dissecting Seraphina&rsquo;s character to her approving
husband. Of course no names were used; and of course
the identity of that abstract or ideal man, with whom
she was currently contrasted, remained an open secret.
But this stiff old gentleman had a wonderful instinct for
evil, thus to wind his way into man&rsquo;s citadel; thus to
harp by the hour on the virtues of his hearer and not
once alarm his self-respect. Otto was all roseate, in and
out, with flattery and Tokay and an approving conscience.
He saw himself in the most attractive colours. If even
Greisengesang, he thought, could thus espy the loose
stitches in Seraphina&rsquo;s character, and thus disloyally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116"></a>116</span>
impart them to the opposite camp, he, the discarded
husband&mdash;the dispossessed Prince&mdash;could scarce have
erred on the side of severity.</p>

<p>In this excellent frame he bade adieu to the old
gentleman, whose voice had proved so musical, and set
forth for the drawing-room. Already on the stair, he
was seized with some compunction; but when he entered
the great gallery and beheld his wife, the Chancellor&rsquo;s
abstract flatteries fell from him like rain, and he reawoke
to the poetic facts of life. She stood a good way off
below a shining lustre, her back turned. The bend of
her waist overcame him with physical weakness. This
was the girl-wife who had lain in his arms and whom he
had sworn to cherish; there was she, who was better
than success.</p>

<p>It was Seraphina who restored him from the blow.
She swam forward and smiled upon her husband with
a sweetness that was insultingly artificial. &ldquo;Fr√©d√©ric,&rdquo;
she lisped, &ldquo;you are late.&rdquo; It was a scene of high comedy,
such as is proper to unhappy marriages; and her <i>aplomb</i>
disgusted him.</p>

<p>There was no etiquette at these small drawing-rooms.
People came and went at pleasure. The window embrasures
became the roost of happy couples; at the
great chimney the talkers mostly congregated, each full-charged
with scandal; and down at the farther end the
gamblers gambled. It was towards this point that Otto
moved, not ostentatiously, but with a gentle insistence,
and scattering attentions as he went. Once abreast of
the card-table, he placed himself opposite to Madame von
Rosen, and, as soon as he had caught her eye, withdrew to
the embrasure of a window. There she had speedily
joined him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You did well to call me,&rdquo; she said, a little wildly.
&ldquo;These cards will be my ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leave them,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; she cried, and laughed; &ldquo;they are my destiny.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117"></a>117</span>
My only chance was to die of consumption; now I must
die in a garret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are bitter to-night,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have been losing,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;You do not
know what greed is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have come, then, in an evil hour,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, you wish a favour!&rdquo; she cried, brightening
beautifully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am about to found my party,
and I come to you for a recruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done,&rdquo; said the Countess. &ldquo;I am a man again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I may be wrong,&rdquo; continued Otto, &ldquo;but I believe
upon my heart you wish me no ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you so well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I dare not tell
it you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then if I ask my favour?&rdquo; quoth the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ask it, <i>mon Prince</i>,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Whatever it
is, it is granted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;this very night to make
the farmer of our talk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven knows your meaning!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
know not, neither care; there are no bounds to my desire
to please you. Call him made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will put it in another way,&rdquo; returned Otto. &ldquo;Did
you ever steal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Often!&rdquo; cried the Countess. &ldquo;I have broken all
the ten commandments; and if there were more to-morrow,
I should not sleep till I had broken these.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a case of burglary: to say the truth, I
thought it would amuse you,&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no practical experience,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but O!
the good-will! I have broken a work-box in my time,
and several hearts, my own included. Never a house!
But it cannot be difficult; sins are so unromantically
easy! What are we to break?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, we are to break the treasury,&rdquo; said Otto;
and he sketched to her briefly, wittily, with here and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118"></a>118</span>
there a touch of pathos, the story of his visit to the farm,
of his promise to buy it, and of the refusal with which
his demand for money had been met that morning at
the council; concluding with a few practical words as
to the treasury windows, and the helps and hindrances
of the proposed exploit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They refused you the money,&rdquo; she said when he
had done. &ldquo;And you accepted the refusal? Well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They gave their reasons,&rdquo; replied Otto, colouring.
&ldquo;They were not such as I could combat; and I am driven
to dilapidate the funds of my own country by a theft.
It is not dignified; but it is fun.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fun,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; And then she remained
silently plunged in thought for an appreciable time. &ldquo;How
much do you require?&rdquo; she asked at length.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three thousand crowns will do,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;for
I have still some money of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; she said, regaining her levity. &ldquo;I am
your true accomplice. And where are we to meet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know the Flying Mercury,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;in
the Park? Three pathways intersect; there they have
made a seat and raised the statue. The spot is handy
and the deity congenial.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; she said, and tapped him with her fan. &ldquo;But
do you know, my Prince, you are an egoist&mdash;your handy
trysting-place is miles from me. You must give me
ample time; I cannot, I think, possibly be there before
two. But as the bell beats two, your helper shall arrive:
welcome, I trust. Stay&mdash;do you bring anyone?&rdquo; she
added. &ldquo;O, it is not for a chaperon&mdash;I am not a prude!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall bring a groom of mine,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;I caught
him stealing corn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His name?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I profess I know not. I am not yet intimate with
my corn-stealer,&rdquo; returned the Prince. &ldquo;It was in a
professional capacity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Like me! Flatterer!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;But oblige me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119"></a>119</span>
in one thing. Let me find you waiting at the seat&mdash;yes,
you shall await me; for on this expedition it shall
be no longer Prince and Countess, it shall be the lady
and the squire&mdash;and your friend the thief shall be no
nearer than the fountain. Do you promise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, in everything you are to command; you
shall be captain, I am but supercargo,&rdquo; answered Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Heaven bring all safe to port!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It
is not Friday!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Something in her manner had puzzled Otto, had possibly
touched him with suspicion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it not strange,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that I should
choose my accomplice from the other camp?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;But it is your only wisdom
that you know your friends.&rdquo; And suddenly, in the
vantage of the deep window, she caught up his hand
and kissed it with a sort of passion. &ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; she
added, &ldquo;go at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went, somewhat staggered, doubting in his heart
that he was over-bold. For in that moment she had
flashed upon him like a jewel; and even through the
strong panoply of a previous love he had been conscious
of a shock. Next moment he had dismissed the fear.</p>

<p>Both Otto and the Countess retired early from the
drawing-room, and the Prince, after an elaborate feint,
dismissed his valet, and went forth by the private passage
and the back postern in quest of the groom.</p>

<p>Once more the stable was in darkness, once more Otto
employed the talismanic knock, and once more the groom
appeared and sickened with terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-evening, friend,&rdquo; said Otto pleasantly. &ldquo;I
want you to bring a corn sack&mdash;empty this time&mdash;and
to accompany me. We shall be gone all night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; groaned the man, &ldquo;I have the
charge of the small stables. I am here alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;you are no such martinet
in duty.&rdquo; And then seeing that the man was shaking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120"></a>120</span>
from head to foot, Otto laid a hand upon his shoulder.
&ldquo;If I meant you harm,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;should I be here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fellow became instantly reassured. He got the
sack; and Otto led him round by several paths and
avenues, conversing pleasantly by the way, and left him
at last planted by a certain fountain where a goggle-eyed
Triton spouted intermittently into a rippling laver.
Thence he proceeded alone to where, in a round clearing,
a copy of Gian Bologna&rsquo;s Mercury stood tiptoe in the
twilight of the stars. The night was warm and windless.
A shaving of new moon had lately arisen; but it was still
too small and too low down in heaven to contend with
the immense host of lesser luminaries; and the rough
face of the earth was drenched with starlight. Down one
of the alleys, which widened as it receded, he could see a
part of the lamplit terrace where a sentry silently paced,
and beyond that a corner of the town with interlacing
street-lights. But all around him the young trees stood
mystically blurred in the dim shine; and in the stock-still
quietness the upleaping god appeared alive.</p>

<p>In this dimness and silence of the night, Otto&rsquo;s conscience
became suddenly and staringly luminous, like the
dial of a city clock. He averted the eyes of his mind, but
the finger, rapidly travelling, pointed to a series of misdeeds
that took his breath away. What was he doing in that
place? The money had been wrongly squandered, but
that was largely by his own neglect. And he now proposed
to embarrass the finances of this country which he had
been too idle to govern. And he now proposed to squander
the money once again, and this time for a private, if a
generous end. And the man whom he had reproved for
stealing corn he was now to set stealing treasure. And
then there was Madame von Rosen, upon whom he looked
down with some of that ill-favoured contempt of the
chaste male for the imperfect woman. Because he thought
of her as one degraded below scruples, he had picked her
out to be still more degraded, and to risk her whole irregular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121"></a>121</span>
establishment in life by complicity in this dishonourable
act. It was uglier than a seduction.</p>

<p>Otto had to walk very briskly and whistle very busily;
and when at last he heard steps in the narrowest and
darkest of the alleys, it was with a gush of relief that
he sprang to meet the Countess. To wrestle alone with
one&rsquo;s good angel is so hard! and so precious, at the proper
time, is a companion certain to be less virtuous than
oneself!</p>

<p>It was a young man who came towards him&mdash;a young
man of small stature and a peculiar gait, wearing a wide
flapping hat, and carrying, with great weariness, a heavy
bag. Otto recoiled; but the young man held up his
hand by way of signal, and coming up with a panting run,
as if with the last of his endurance, laid the bag upon the
ground, threw himself upon the bench, and disclosed the
features of Madame von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Countess!&rdquo; cried the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she panted, &ldquo;the Count von Rosen&mdash;my
young brother. A capital fellow. Let him get his
breath.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam ...&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Call me Count,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;respect my <i>incognito</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Count be it, then,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And let me implore
that gallant gentleman to set forth at once on our enterprise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sit down beside me here,&rdquo; she returned, patting
the farther corner of the bench. &ldquo;I will follow you in a
moment. O, I am so tired&mdash;feel how my heart leaps!
Where is your thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;At his post,&rdquo; replied Otto. &ldquo;Shall I introduce him?
He seems an excellent companion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do not hurry me yet. I must speak
to you. Not but I adore your thief; I adore anyone
who has the spirit to do wrong. I never cared for virtue
till I fell in love with my Prince.&rdquo; She laughed musically.
&ldquo;And even so, it is not for your virtues,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page122"></a>122</span></p>

<p>Otto was embarrassed. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;if
you are anyway rested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Presently, presently. Let me breathe,&rdquo; she said,
panting a little harder than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what has so wearied you?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;This
bag? And why, in the name of eccentricity, a bag? For
an empty one, you might have relied on my own foresight;
and this one is very far from being empty. My dear
Count, with what trash have you come laden? But the
shortest method is to see for myself.&rdquo; And he put down
his hand.</p>

<p>She stopped him at once. &ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;no&mdash;not
that way. I will tell, I will make a clean breast. It
is done already. I have robbed the treasury single-handed.
There are three thousand two hundred crowns. O, I
trust it is enough!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her embarrassment was so obvious that the Prince
was struck into a muse, gazing in her face, with his hand
still outstretched and she still holding him by the wrist.
&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;How?&rdquo; And then drawing
himself up, &ldquo;O, madam,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I understand. You
must indeed think meanly of the Prince.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well then, it was a lie!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The money is
mine, honestly my own&mdash;now yours. This was an unworthy
act that you proposed. But I love your honour,
and I swore to myself that I should save it in your teeth.
I beg of you to let me save it&rdquo;&mdash;with a sudden lovely
change of tone. &ldquo;Otto, I beseech you let me save it.
Take this dross from your poor friend who loves you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, madam,&rdquo; babbled Otto, in the extreme of
misery, &ldquo;I cannot&mdash;I must go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he half rose; but she was on the ground before
him in an instant, clasping his knees. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she gasped,
&ldquo;you shall not go. Do you despise me so entirely? It
is dross; I hate it; I should squander it at play and be
no richer; it is an investment; it is to save me from ruin.
Otto,&rdquo; she cried, as he again feebly tried to put her from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123"></a>123</span>
him, &ldquo;if you leave me alone in this disgrace I will die
here!&rdquo; He groaned aloud. &ldquo;O,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;think
what I suffer! If you suffer from a piece of delicacy,
think what I suffer in my shame! To have my trash
refused! You would rather steal, you think of me so
basely! You would rather tread my heart in pieces!
O unkind! O my Prince! O Otto! O pity me!&rdquo;
She was still clasping him; then she found his hand and
covered it with kisses, and at this his head began to turn.
&ldquo;O,&rdquo; she cried again, &ldquo;I see it! O what a horror! It
is because I am old, because I am no longer beautiful.&rdquo;
And she burst into a storm of sobs.</p>

<p>This was the <i>coup de gr√¢ce</i>. Otto had now to comfort
and compose her as he could, and before many words, the
money was accepted. Between the woman and the weak
man such was the inevitable end. Madame von Rosen
instantly composed her sobs. She thanked him with a
fluttering voice, and resumed her place upon the bench at
the far end from Otto. &ldquo;Now you see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;why I
bade you keep the thief at distance, and why I came alone.
How I trembled for my treasure!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Otto, with a tearful whimper in his
voice, &ldquo;spare me! You are too good, too noble!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder to hear you,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;You have
avoided a great folly. You will be able to meet your
good old peasant. You have found an excellent investment
for a friend&rsquo;s money. You have preferred
essential kindness to an empty scruple; and now you are
ashamed of it! You have made your friend happy; and
now you mourn as the dove! Come, cheer up. I know
it is depressing to have done exactly right; but you need
not make a practice of it. Forgive yourself this virtue;
come now, look me in the face and smile!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did look at her. When a man has been embraced
by a woman, he sees her in a glamour; and at such a
time, in the baffling glimmer of the stars, she will look
wildly well. The hair is touched with light; the eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124"></a>124</span>
are constellations; the face sketched in shadows&mdash;a
sketch, you might say, by passion. Otto became consoled
for his defeat; he began to take an interest.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am no ingrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You promised me fun,&rdquo; she returned, with a laugh.
&ldquo;I have given you as good. We have had a stormy
<i>scena</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He laughed in his turn, and the sound of the laughter,
in either case, was hardly reassuring.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, what are you going to give me in exchange,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;for my excellent declamation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What you will,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever I will? Upon your honour? Suppose I
ask the crown?&rdquo; She was flashing upon him, beautiful in
triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my honour,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I ask the crown?&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Nay;
what should I do with it? Gr√ºnewald is but a petty state;
my ambition swells above it. I shall ask&mdash;I find I want
nothing,&rdquo; she concluded. &ldquo;I will give you something
instead. I will give you leave to kiss me&mdash;once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto drew near, and she put up her face; they were
both smiling, both on the brink of laughter, all was so
innocent and playful; and the Prince, when their lips
encountered, was dumfoundered by the sudden convulsion
of his being. Both drew instantly apart, and for an
appreciable time sat tongue-tied. Otto was indistinctly
conscious of a peril in the silence, but could find no words
to utter. Suddenly the Countess seemed to awake. &ldquo;As
for your wife&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began in a clear and steady voice.</p>

<p>The word recalled Otto, with a shudder, from his trance.
&ldquo;I will hear nothing against my wife,&rdquo; he cried wildly;
and then, recovering himself and in a kindlier tone, &ldquo;I
will tell you my one secret,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I love my wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should have let me finish,&rdquo; she returned, smiling.
&ldquo;Do you suppose I did not mention her on purpose? You
know you had lost your head. Well, so had I. Come
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125"></a>125</span>
now, do not be abashed by words,&rdquo; she added somewhat
sharply. &ldquo;It is the one thing I despise. If you are not a
fool, you will see that I am building fortresses about your
virtue. And at any rate, I choose that you shall understand
that I am not dying of love for you. It is a very
smiling business; no tragedy for me! And now here is
what I have to say about your wife: she is not and she
never has been Gondremark&rsquo;s mistress. Be sure he would
have boasted if she had. Good-night!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And in a moment she was gone down the alley, and
Otto was alone with the bag of money and the flying god.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>GOTTHOLD&rsquo;S REVISED OPINION; AND THE FALL
COMPLETED</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> Countess left poor Otto with a caress and buffet
simultaneously administered. The welcome word about
his wife and the virtuous ending of his interview should
doubtless have delighted him. But for all that, as he
shouldered the bag of money and set forward to rejoin his
groom, he was conscious of many aching sensibilities.
To have gone wrong and to have been set right makes
but a double trial for man&rsquo;s vanity. The discovery of
his own weakness and possible unfaith had staggered him
to the heart; and to hear, in the same hour, of his wife&rsquo;s
fidelity from one who loved her not, increased the bitterness
of the surprise.</p>

<p>He was about halfway between the fountain and the
Flying Mercury before his thoughts began to be clear;
and he was surprised to find them resentful. He paused
in a kind of temper, and struck with his hand a little shrub.
Thence there arose instantly a cloud of awakened sparrows,
which as instantly dispersed and disappeared into the
thicket. He looked at them stupidly, and when they were
gone continued staring at the stars. &ldquo;I am angry. By
what right? By none!&rdquo; he thought; but he was still
angry. He cursed Madame von Rosen and instantly
repented. Heavy was the money on his shoulders.</p>

<p>When he reached the fountain, he did, out of ill-humour
and parade, an unpardonable act. He gave the money
bodily to the dishonest groom. &ldquo;Keep this for me,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;until I call for it to-morrow. It is a great sum, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127"></a>127</span>
by that you will judge that I have not condemned you.&rdquo;
And he strode away ruffling, as if he had done something
generous. It was a desperate stroke to re-enter at the
point of the bayonet into his self-esteem; and, like all
such, it was fruitless in the end. He got to bed with the
devil, it appeared: kicked and tumbled till the grey of
the morning; and then fell inopportunely into a leaden
slumber, and awoke to find it ten. To miss the appointment
with old Killian after all had been too tragic a miscarriage:
and he hurried with all his might, found the
groom (for a wonder) faithful to his trust, and arrived
only a few minutes before noon in the guest-chamber of
the &ldquo;Morning Star.&rdquo; Killian was there in his Sunday&rsquo;s
best and looking very gaunt and rigid; a lawyer from
Brandenau stood sentinel over his outspread papers; and
the groom and the landlord of the inn were called to serve
as witnesses. The obvious deference of that great man,
the innkeeper, plainly affected the old farmer with surprise;
but it was not until Otto had taken the pen and
signed that the truth flashed upon him fully. Then,
indeed, he was beside himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His Highness!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;His Highness!&rdquo; and
repeated the exclamation till his mind had grappled fairly
with the facts. Then he turned to the witnesses. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;you dwell in a country highly favoured
by God; for of all generous gentlemen, I will say it on my
conscience, this one is the king. I am an old man, and I
have seen good and bad, and the year of the great famine;
but a more excellent gentleman, no, never.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; cried the landlord, &ldquo;we know that
well in Gr√ºnewald. If we saw more of his Highness we
should be the better pleased.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is the kindest Prince,&rdquo; began the groom, and
suddenly closed his mouth upon a sob, so that every one
turned to gaze upon his emotion&mdash;Otto not last; Otto
struck with remorse, to see the man so grateful.</p>

<p>Then it was the lawyer&rsquo;s turn to pay a compliment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128"></a>128</span>
&ldquo;I do not know what Providence may hold in store,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but this day should be a bright one in the annals of
your reign. The shouts of armies could not be more
eloquent than the emotion on these honest faces.&rdquo; And
the Brandenau lawyer bowed, skipped, stepped back and
took snuff, with the air of a man who has found and seized
an opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentleman,&rdquo; said Killian, &ldquo;if you will
pardon me the plainness of calling you a gentleman, many
a good day&rsquo;s work you have done, I doubt not, but never
a better, or one that will be better blessed; and whatever,
sir, may be your happiness and triumph in that high sphere
to which you have been called, it will be none the worse, sir,
for an old man&rsquo;s blessing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene had almost assumed the proportions of an
ovation; and when the Prince escaped he had but one
thought: to go wherever he was most sure of praise.
His conduct at the board of council occurred to him as a
fair chapter; and this evoked the memory of Gotthold.
To Gotthold he would go.</p>

<p>Gotthold was in the library as usual, and laid down his
pen, a little angrily, on Otto&rsquo;s entrance. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;here you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Otto, &ldquo;we made a revolution, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is what I fear,&rdquo; returned the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;Fear? Fear is the burnt
child. I have learned my strength and the weakness of
the others; and I now mean to govern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gotthold said nothing, but he looked down and
smoothed his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You disapprove?&rdquo; cried Otto. &ldquo;You are a weather-cock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;My observation
has confirmed my fears. It will not do, Otto, not do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will not do?&rdquo; demanded the Prince, with a
sickening stab of pain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page129"></a>129</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;None of it,&rdquo; answered Gotthold. &ldquo;You are unfitted
for a life of action; you lack the stamina, the habit, the
restraint, the patience. Your wife is greatly better, vastly
better; and though she is in bad hands, displays a very
different aptitude. She is a woman of affairs; you are&mdash;dear
boy, you are yourself. I bid you back to your amusements;
like a smiling dominie, I give you holidays for life.
Yes,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;there is a day appointed for all
when they shall turn again upon their own philosophy.
I had grown to disbelieve impartially in all; and if in the
atlas of the sciences there were two charts I disbelieved in
more than all the rest, they were politics and morals. I
had a sneaking kindness for your vices; as they were
negative, they flattered my philosophy; and I called them
almost virtues. Well, Otto, I was wrong; I have forsworn
my sceptical philosophy; and I perceive your faults
to be unpardonable. You are unfit to be a Prince, unfit
to be a husband. And I give you my word, I would rather
see a man capably doing evil than blundering about good.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Otto was still silent, in extreme dudgeon.</p>

<p>Presently the Doctor resumed: &ldquo;I will take the smaller
matter first: your conduct to your wife. You went, I
hear, and had an explanation. That may have been right
or wrong; I know not; at least, you had stirred her
temper. At the council she insults you; well, you insult
her back&mdash;a man to a woman, a husband to his wife, in
public! Next, upon the back of this, you propose&mdash;the
story runs like wildfire&mdash;to recall the power of signature.
Can she ever forgive that? a woman&mdash;a young woman&mdash;ambitious,
conscious of talents beyond yours? Never,
Otto. And to sum all, at such a crisis in your married life,
you get into a window corner with that ogling dame von
Rosen. I do not dream that there was any harm; but I
do say it was an idle disrespect to your wife. Why, man,
the woman is not decent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gotthold,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;I will hear no evil of the
Countess.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page130"></a>130</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You will certainly hear no good of her,&rdquo; returned
Gotthold; &ldquo;and if you wish your wife to be the pink
of nicety, you should clear your court of demi-reputations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The commonplace injustice of a by-word,&rdquo; Otto cried.
&ldquo;The partiality of sex. She is a demirep; what then is
Gondremark? Were she a man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be all one,&rdquo; retorted Gotthold roughly.
&ldquo;When I see a man, come to years of wisdom, who speaks
in double-meanings and is the braggart of his vices, I spit
on the other side. &lsquo;You, my friend,&rsquo; say I, &lsquo;are not even a
gentleman.&rsquo; Well, she&rsquo;s not even a lady.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is the best friend I have, and I choose that she
shall be respected,&rdquo; Otto said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she is your friend, so much the worse,&rdquo; replied
the Doctor. &ldquo;It will not stop there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Otto, &ldquo;there is the charity of virtue!
All evil in the spotted fruit. But I can tell you, sir, that
you do Madame von Rosen prodigal injustice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can tell me!&rdquo; said the Doctor shrewdly. &ldquo;Have
you tried? have you been riding the marches?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The blood came into Otto&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried Gotthold, &ldquo;look at your wife and blush!
There&rsquo;s a wife for a man to marry and then lose! She&rsquo;s
a carnation, Otto. The soul is in her eyes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have changed your note for Seraphina, I perceive,&rdquo;
said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Changed it!&rdquo; cried the Doctor, with a flush. &ldquo;Why,
when was it different? But I own I admired her at the
council. When she sat there silent, tapping with her foot,
I admired her as I might a hurricane. Were I one of those
who venture upon matrimony, there had been the prize to
tempt me! She invites, as Mexico invited Cortez; the
enterprise is hard, the natives are unfriendly&mdash;I believe
them cruel too&mdash;but the metropolis is paved with gold and
the breeze blows out of paradise. Yes, I could desire to be
that conqueror. But to philander with von Rosen! never!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131"></a>131</span>
Senses? I discard them; what are they?&mdash;pruritus!
Curiosity? Reach me my Anatomy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To whom do you address yourself?&rdquo; cried Otto.
&ldquo;Surely you, of all men, know that I love my wife!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, love!&rdquo; cried Gotthold; &ldquo;love is a great word;
it is in all the dictionaries. If you had loved, she would
have paid you back. What does she ask? A little
ardour!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hard to love for two,&rdquo; replied the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hard? Why, there&rsquo;s the touchstone! O, I know
my poets!&rdquo; cried the Doctor. &ldquo;We are but dust and
fire, too arid to endure life&rsquo;s scorching; and love, like
the shadow of a great rock, should lend shelter and refreshment,
not to the lover only, but to his mistress and
to the children that reward them; and their very friends
should seek repose in the fringes of that peace. Love is
not love that cannot build a home. And you call it love
to grudge and quarrel and pick faults? You call it love
to thwart her to her face, and bandy insults? Love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gotthold, you are unjust. I was then fighting for
my country,&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, and there&rsquo;s the worst of all,&rdquo; returned the Doctor.
&ldquo;You could not even see that you were wrong; that,
being where they were, retreat was ruin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you supported me!&rdquo; cried Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did. I was a fool like you,&rdquo; replied Gotthold. &ldquo;But
now my eyes are open. If you go on as you have started,
disgrace this fellow Gondremark, and publish the scandal
of your divided house, there will befall a most abominable
thing in Gr√ºnewald. A revolution, friend&mdash;a revolution.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak strangely for a red,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A red republican, but not a revolutionary,&rdquo; returned
the Doctor. &ldquo;An ugly thing is a Gr√ºnewalder drunk!
One man alone can save the country from this pass, and
that is the double-dealer Gondremark, with whom I conjure
you to make peace. It will not be you; it never can
be you:&mdash;you, who can do nothing, as your wife said, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132"></a>132</span>
trade upon your station&mdash;you, who spent the hours in
begging money! And in God&rsquo;s name, what for? Why
money? What mystery of idiocy was this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was to no ill end. It was to buy a farm,&rdquo; quoth
Otto sulkily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To buy a farm!&rdquo; cried Gotthold. &ldquo;Buy a farm!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo; returned Otto. &ldquo;I have bought
it, if you come to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gotthold fairly bounded on his seat. &ldquo;And how that?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; repeated Otto, startled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, verily, how!&rdquo; returned the Doctor. &ldquo;How
came you by the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince&rsquo;s countenance darkened. &ldquo;That is my
affair,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see you are ashamed,&rdquo; retorted Gotthold. &ldquo;And
so you bought a farm in the hour of your country&rsquo;s need&mdash;doubtless
to be ready for the abdication; and I put it that
you stole the funds. There are not three ways of getting
money: there are but two: to earn and steal. And
now, when you have combined Charles the Fifth and Long-fingered
Tom, you come to me to fortify your vanity!
But I will clear my mind upon this matter: until I know
the right and wrong of the transaction, I put my hand
behind my back. A man may be the pitifullest prince;
he must be a spotless gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Prince had gotten to his feet, as pale as paper.
&ldquo;Gotthold,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you drive me beyond bounds.
Beware, sir, beware!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you threaten me, friend Otto?&rdquo; asked the Doctor
grimly. &ldquo;That would be a strange conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When have you ever known me use my power in any
private animosity?&rdquo; cried Otto. &ldquo;To any private man
your words were an unpardonable insult, but at me you
shoot in full security, and I must turn aside to compliment
you on your plainness. I must do more than pardon, I
must admire, because you have faced this&mdash;this formidable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133"></a>133</span>
monarch, like a Nathan before David. You have uprooted
an old kindness, sir, with an unsparing hand. You leave
me very bare. My last bond is broken; and though I
take Heaven to witness that I sought to do the right, I have
this reward: to find myself alone. You say I am no
gentleman; yet the sneers have been upon your side; and
though I can very well perceive where you have lodged
your sympathies, I will forbear the taunt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto, are you insane?&rdquo; cried Gotthold, leaping up.
&ldquo;Because I ask you how you came by certain moneys,
and because you refuse&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr von Hohenstockwitz, I have ceased to invite your
aid in my affairs,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;I have heard all that I
desire, and you have sufficiently trampled on my vanity. It
may be that I cannot govern, it may be that I cannot love&mdash;you
tell me so with every mark of honesty; but God has
granted me one virtue, and I can still forgive. I forgive
you; even in this hour of passion I can perceive my faults
and your excuses; and if I desire that in future I may be
spared your conversation, it is not, sir, from resentment&mdash;not
resentment&mdash;but, by Heaven, because no man on
earth could endure to be so rated. You have the satisfaction
to see your sovereign weep; and that person
whom you have so often taunted with his happiness reduced
to the last pitch of solitude and misery. No,&mdash;I will hear
nothing; I claim the last word, sir, as your Prince; and
that last word shall be&mdash;forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with that Otto was gone from the apartment, and
Dr. Gotthold was left alone with the most conflicting
sentiments of sorrow, remorse, and merriment; walking
to and fro before his table, and asking himself, with hands
uplifted, which of the pair of them was most to blame for
this unhappy rupture. Presently, he took from a cupboard
a bottle of Rhine wine and a goblet of the deep Bohemian
ruby. The first glass a little warmed and comforted his
bosom; with the second he began to look down upon
these troubles from a sunny mountain; yet a while, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134"></a>134</span>
filled with this false comfort and contemplating life through
a golden medium, he owned to himself, with a flush, a
smile, and a half-pleasurable sigh, that he had been somewhat
over plain in dealing with his cousin. &ldquo;He said the
truth, too,&rdquo; added the penitent librarian, &ldquo;for in my
monkish fashion I adore the Princess.&rdquo; And then, with
a still deepening flush and a certain stealth, although he
sat all alone in that great gallery, he toasted Seraphina to
the dregs.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE FIRST
SHE BEGUILES THE BARON</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">At</span> a sufficiently late hour, or, to be more exact, at three
in the afternoon, Madame von Rosen issued on the world.
She swept downstairs and out across the garden, a black
mantilla thrown over her head, and the long train of her
black velvet dress ruthlessly sweeping in the dirt.</p>

<p>At the other end of that long garden, and back to back
with the villa of the Countess, stood the large mansion where
the Prime Minister transacted his affairs and pleasures.
This distance, which was enough for decency by the easy
canons of Mittwalden, the Countess swiftly traversed,
opened a little door with a key, mounted a flight of stairs,
and entered unceremoniously into Gondremark&rsquo;s study.
It was a large and very high apartment; books all about
the walls, papers on the table, papers on the floor; here
and there a picture, somewhat scant of drapery; a great
fire glowing and flaming in the blue-tiled hearth; and the
daylight streaming through a cupola above. In the midst
of this sat the great Baron Gondremark in his shirt-sleeves,
his business for that day fairly at an end, and the hour
arrived for relaxation. His expression, his very nature,
seemed to have undergone a fundamental change. Gondremark
at home appeared the very antipode of Gondremark
on duty. He had an air of massive jollity that well became
him; grossness and geniality sat upon his features; and
along with his manners, he had laid aside his sly and
sinister expression. He lolled there, sunning his bulk
before the fire, a noble animal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page136"></a>136</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;At last!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess stepped into the room in silence, threw
herself on a chair, and crossed her legs. In her lace and
velvet, with a good display of smooth black stocking and
of snowy petticoat, and with the refined profile of her face
and slender plumpness of her body, she showed in
singular contrast to the big, black, intellectual satyr by
the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How often do you send for me?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It
is compromising.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gondremark laughed. &ldquo;Speaking of that,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;what in the devil&rsquo;s name were you about? You were
not home till morning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was giving alms,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>The Baron again laughed loud and long, for in his
shirt-sleeves he was a very mirthful creature. &ldquo;It is
fortunate I am not jealous,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;But you
know my way: pleasure and liberty go hand in hand.
I believe what I believe; it is not much, but I believe it.&mdash;But
now to business. Have you not read my letter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;my head ached.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, well! then I have news indeed!&rdquo; cried Gondremark.
&ldquo;I was mad to see you all last night and all this
morning: for yesterday afternoon I brought my long
business to a head; the ship has come home; one more
dead lift, and I shall cease to fetch and carry for the Princess
Ratafia. Yes, &rsquo;tis done. I have the order all in Ratafia&rsquo;s
hand; I carry it on my heart. At the hour of twelve to-night,
Prince Featherhead is to be taken in his bed, and,
like the bambino, whipped into a chariot; and by next
morning he will command a most romantic prospect from
the donjon of the Felsenburg. Farewell, Featherhead!
The war goes on, the girl is in my hand; I have long been
indispensable, but now I shall be sole. I have long,&rdquo; he
added exultingly, &ldquo;long carried this intrigue upon my
shoulders, like Samson with the gates of Gaza; now I
discharge that burthen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page137"></a>137</span></p>

<p>She had sprung to her feet a little paler. &ldquo;Is this
true?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you a fact,&rdquo; he asseverated. &ldquo;The trick is
played.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will never believe it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;An order? In
her own hand? I will never believe it, Heinrich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear to you,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, what do you care for oaths&mdash;or I either? What
would you swear by? Wine, women, and song? It is
not binding,&rdquo; she said. She had come quite close up to
him and laid her hand upon his arm. &ldquo;As for the order&mdash;no,
Heinrich, never! I will never believe it. I will die
ere I believe it. You have some secret purpose&mdash;what, I
cannot guess&mdash;but not one word of it is true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I show it you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;There is no such
thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Incorrigible Sadducee!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Well, I will
convert you; you shall see the order.&rdquo; He moved to a
chair where he had thrown his coat, and then drawing
forth and holding out a paper, &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>She took it greedily, and her eye flashed as she
perused it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; cried the Baron, &ldquo;there falls a dynasty, and
it was I that felled it; and I and you inherit!&rdquo; He
seemed to swell in stature; and next moment, with a
laugh, he put his hand forward. &ldquo;Give me the dagger,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>But she whisked the paper suddenly behind her back
and faced him, lowering. &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
and I have first a point to settle. Do you suppose me
blind? She could never have given that paper but to
one man, and that man her lover. Here you stand&mdash;her
lover, her accomplice, her master&mdash;O, I well believe
it, for I know your power. But what am I?&rdquo; she cried;
&ldquo;I, whom you deceive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jealousy!&rdquo; cried Gondremark. &ldquo;Anna, I would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138"></a>138</span>
never have believed it! But I declare to you by all that&rsquo;s
credible that I am not her lover. I might be, I suppose;
but I never yet durst risk the declaration. The chit is so
unreal; a mincing doll; she will and she will not; there
is no counting on her, by God! And hitherto I have
had my own way without, and keep the lover in reserve.
And I say, Anna,&rdquo; he added with severity, &ldquo;you must
break yourself of this new fit, my girl; there must be no
combustion. I keep the creature under the belief that I
adore her; and if she caught a breath of you and me, she
is such a fool, prude, and dog in the manger, that she is
capable of spoiling all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All very fine,&rdquo; returned the lady. &ldquo;With whom do
you pass your days? and which am I to believe, your
words or your actions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna, the devil take you, are you blind?&rdquo; cried
Gondremark. &ldquo;You know me. Am I likely to care for
such a preciosa? &rsquo;Tis hard that we should have been
together for so long, and you should still take me for a
troubadour. But if there is one thing that I despise and
deprecate, it is all such figures in Berlin wool. Give me a
human woman&mdash;like yourself. You are my mate; you
were made for me; you amuse me like the play. And
what have I to gain that I should pretend to you? If I
do not love you, what use are you to me? Why, none.
It is as clear as noonday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you love me, Heinrich?&rdquo; she asked, languishing.
&ldquo;Do you truly?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I love you next after myself.
I should be all abroad if I had lost you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said she, folding up the paper and putting
it calmly in her pocket, &ldquo;I will believe you, and I join the
plot. Count upon me. At midnight, did you say? It is
Gordon, I see, that you have charged with it. Excellent;
he will stick at nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gondremark watched her suspiciously. &ldquo;Why do you
take the paper?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Give it here.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page139"></a>139</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;I mean to keep it. It is I who
must prepare the stroke; you cannot manage it without
me; and to do my best I must possess the paper. Where
shall I find Gordon? In his rooms?&rdquo; She spoke with a
rather feverish self-possession.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna,&rdquo; he said sternly, the black, bilious countenance
of his palace <i>r√¥le</i> taking the place of the more open favour
of his hours at home, &ldquo;I ask you for that paper. Once,
twice, and thrice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heinrich,&rdquo; she returned, looking him in the face,
&ldquo;take care. I will put up with no dictation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Both looked dangerous; and the silence lasted for
a measurable interval of time. Then she made haste to
have the first word; and with a laugh that rang clear and
honest, &ldquo;Do not be a child,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wonder at you.
If your assurances are true, you can have no reason to
mistrust me, nor I to play you false. The difficulty is to
get the Prince out of the palace without scandal. His
valets are devoted; his chamberlain a slave; and yet
one cry might ruin all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be overpowered,&rdquo; he said, following her
to the new ground, &ldquo;and disappear along with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your whole scheme along with them!&rdquo; she
cried. &ldquo;He does not take his servants when he goes a-hunting:
a child could read the truth. No, no; the
plan is idiotic; it must be Ratafia&rsquo;s. But hear me. You
know the Prince worships me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Poor Featherhead, I cross his
destiny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;what if I bring him
alone out of the palace, to some quiet corner of the Park&mdash;the
Flying Mercury, for instance? Gordon can be posted
in the thicket; the carriage wait behind the temple; not
a cry, not a scuffle, not a footfall; simply, the Prince
vanishes!&mdash;What do you say? Am I an able ally?
Are my <i>beaux yeux</i> of service? Ah, Heinrich, do not
lose your Anna!&mdash;she has power!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140"></a>140</span></p>

<p>He struck with his open hand upon the chimney.
&ldquo;Witch!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there is not your match for devilry
in Europe. Service! the thing runs on wheels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kiss me, then, and let me go. I must not miss my
Featherhead,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stay, stay,&rdquo; said the Baron; &ldquo;not so fast. I wish,
upon my soul, that I could trust you; but you are, out
and in, so whimsical a devil that I dare not. Hang it,
Anna, no; it&rsquo;s not possible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You doubt me, Heinrich?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doubt is not the word,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I know you.
Once you were clear of me with that paper in your pocket,
who knows what you would do with it?&mdash;not you, at
least&mdash;nor I. You see,&rdquo; he added, shaking his head
paternally upon the Countess, &ldquo;you are as vicious as a
monkey.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear to you,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;by my salvation....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no curiosity to hear you swearing,&rdquo; said the
Baron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You think that I have no religion? You suppose me
destitute of honour. Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;see here: I will
not argue, but I tell you once for all: leave me this order,
and the Prince shall be arrested&mdash;take it from me, and, as
certain as I speak, I will upset the coach. Trust me, or
fear me; take your choice.&rdquo; And she offered him the
paper.</p>

<p>The Baron, in a great contention of mind, stood
irresolute, weighing the two dangers. Once his hand
advanced, then dropped. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;since trust
is what you call it....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; she interrupted. &ldquo;Do not spoil your
attitude. And now since you have behaved like a good
sort of fellow in the dark, I will condescend to tell you
why. I go to the palace to arrange with Gordon; but
how is Gordon to obey me? And how can I foresee the
hours? It may be midnight; ay, and it may be nightfall;
all&rsquo;s a chance; and to act, I must be free and hold the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141"></a>141</span>
strings of the adventure. And now,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;your
Vivien goes. Dub me your knight!&rdquo; And she held out
her arms and smiled upon him radiant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when he had kissed her, &ldquo;every man
must have his folly; I thank God mine is no worse. Off
with you! I have given a child a squib.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h5>PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE SECOND
SHE INFORMS THE PRINCE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> was the first impulse of Madame von Rosen to return
to her own villa and revise her toilette. Whatever else
should come of this adventure it was her firm design to pay
a visit to the Princess. And before that woman, so little
beloved, the Countess would appear at no disadvantage.
It was the work of minutes. Von Rosen had the captain&rsquo;s
eye in matters of the toilette; she was none of those who
hang in Fabian helplessness among their finery, and, after
hours, come forth upon the world as dowdies. A glance, a
loosened curl, a studied and admired disorder in the hair,
a bit of lace, a touch of colour, a yellow rose in the bosom;
and the instant picture was complete.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bid my carriage follow
me to the palace. In half an hour it should be there
in waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The night was beginning to fall and the shops to shine
with lamps along the tree-beshadowed thoroughfares of
Otto&rsquo;s capital, when the Countess started on her high
emprise. She was jocund at heart; pleasure and interest
had winged her beauty, and she knew it. She paused before
the glowing jeweller&rsquo;s; she remarked and praised
a costume in the milliner&rsquo;s window; and when she reached
the lime-tree walk, with its high, umbrageous arches and
stir of passers-by in the dim alleys, she took her place upon
a bench and began to dally with the pleasures of the hour.
It was cold, but she did not feel it, being warm within;
her thoughts, in that dark corner, shone like the gold and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143"></a>143</span>
rubies at the jeweller&rsquo;s; her ears, which heard the brushing
of so many footfalls, transposed it into music.</p>

<p>What was she to do? She held the paper by which all
depended. Otto and Gondremark and Ratafia, and the
state itself, hung light in her balances, as light as dust;
her little finger laid in either scale would set all flying:
and she hugged herself upon her huge preponderance, and
then laughed aloud to think how giddily it might be used.
The vertigo of omnipotence, the disease of C√¶sars, shook
her reason. &ldquo;O, the mad world!&rdquo; she thought, and
laughed aloud in exultation.</p>

<p>A child, finger in mouth, had paused a little way from
where she sat, and stared with cloudy interest upon this
laughing lady. She called it nearer; but the child hung
back. Instantly, with that curious passion which you
may see any woman in the world display, on the most
odd occasions, for a similar end, the Countess bent herself
with singleness of mind to overcome this diffidence; and
presently, sure enough, the child was seated on her knee,
thumbing and glowering at her watch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you had a clay bear and a china monkey,&rdquo; asked
von Rosen, &ldquo;which would you prefer to break?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I have neither,&rdquo; said the child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;here is a bright florin, with which
you may purchase both the one and the other; and I shall
give it you at once, if you will answer my question. The
clay bear or the china monkey&mdash;come?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the unbreeched soothsayer only stared upon the
florin with big eyes; the oracle could not be persuaded
to reply; and the Countess kissed him lightly, gave him
the florin, set him down upon the path, and resumed her
way with swinging and elastic gait.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Which shall I break?&rdquo; she wondered; and she passed
her hand with delight among the careful disarrangement
of her locks. &ldquo;Which?&rdquo; and she consulted heaven
with her bright eyes. &ldquo;Do I love both or neither? A
little&mdash;passionately&mdash;not at all? Both or neither&mdash;both,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144"></a>144</span>
I believe; but at least I will make hay of
Ratafia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By the time she had passed the iron gates, mounted
the drive, and set her foot upon the broad-flagged terrace,
the night had come completely; the palace front was
thick with lighted windows; and along the balustrade,
the lamp on every twentieth baluster shone clear. A few
withered tracks of sunset, amber and glow-worm green,
still lingered in the western sky; and she paused once
again to watch them fading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And to think,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that here am I&mdash;destiny
embodied, a norn, a fate, a providence&mdash;and have no
guess upon which side I shall declare myself! What
other woman in my place would not be prejudiced, and
think herself committed? But, thank Heaven! I was
born just!&rdquo; Otto&rsquo;s windows were bright among the rest,
and she looked on them with rising tenderness. &ldquo;How
does it feel to be deserted?&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;Poor dear
fool! The girl deserves that he should see this order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Without more delay, she passed into the palace and
asked for an audience of Prince Otto. The Prince, she
was told, was in his own apartment, and desired to be
private. She sent her name. A man presently returned
with word that the Prince tendered his apologies, but
could see no one. &ldquo;Then I will write,&rdquo; she said, and
scribbled a few lines alleging urgency of life and death.
&ldquo;Help me, my Prince,&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;none but you can
help me.&rdquo; This time the messenger returned more speedily,
and begged the Countess to follow him: the Prince was
graciously pleased to receive the Frau Gr√§fin von Rosen.</p>

<p>Otto sat by the fire in his large armoury, weapons faintly
glittering all about him in the changeful light. His face
was disfigured by the marks of weeping; he looked sour
and sad; nor did he rise to greet his visitor, but bowed,
and bade the man begone. That kind of general tenderness
which served the Countess for both heart and conscience,
sharply smote her at this spectacle of grief and weakness;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145"></a>145</span>
she began immediately to enter into the spirit of her part;
and as soon as they were alone, taking one step forward
and with a magnificent gesture&mdash;&ldquo;Up!&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame von Rosen,&rdquo; replied Otto dully, &ldquo;you have
used strong words. You speak of life and death. Pray,
madam, who is threatened? Who is there,&rdquo; he added
bitterly, &ldquo;so destitute that even Otto of Gr√ºnewald can
assist him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;First learn,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the names of the conspirators:
the Princess and the Baron Gondremark. Can you not
guess the rest?&rdquo; And then, as he maintained his silence&mdash;&ldquo;You!&rdquo;
she cried, pointing at him with her finger. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis
you they threaten! Your rascal and mine have laid
their heads together and condemned you. But they
reckoned without you and me. We make a <i>partie carr√©e</i>,
Prince, in love and politics. They lead an ace, but we
shall trump it. Come, partner, shall I draw my card?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;explain yourself. Indeed I fail to
comprehend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, then,&rdquo; said she: and handed him the order.</p>

<p>He took it, looked upon it with a start; and then, still
without speech, he put his hand before his face. She
waited for a word in vain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;do you take the thing down-heartedly?
As well seek wine in a milk-pail as love in
that girl&rsquo;s heart! Be done with this, and be a man. After
the league of the lions, let us have a conspiracy of mice,
and pull this piece of machinery to ground. You were
brisk enough last night when nothing was at stake and
all was frolic. Well, here is better sport; here is life
indeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got to his feet with some alacrity, and his face, which
was a little flushed, bore the marks of resolution.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame von Rosen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am neither unconscious
nor ungrateful; this is the true continuation of
your friendship; but I see that I must disappoint your
expectations. You seem to expect from me some effort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146"></a>146</span>
of resistance; but why should I resist? I have not much
to gain; and now that I have read this paper, and the last
of a fool&rsquo;s paradise is shattered, it would be hyperbolical
to speak of loss in the same breath with Otto of Gr√ºnewald.
I have no party, no policy; no pride, nor anything
to be proud of. For what benefit or principle under
Heaven do you expect me to contend? Or would you
have me bite and scratch like a trapped weasel? No,
madam; signify to those who sent you my readiness to
go. I would at least avoid a scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go?&mdash;of your own will, you go?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot say so much, perhaps,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;but
I go with good alacrity. I have desired a change some
time; behold one offered me! Shall I refuse? Thank
God, I am not so destitute of humour as to make a tragedy
of such a farce.&rdquo; He flicked the order on the table. &ldquo;You
may signify my readiness,&rdquo; he added grandly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you are more angry than you own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I, madam? angry?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You rave! I
have no cause for anger. In every way I have been
taught my weakness, my instability, and my unfitness
for the world. I am a plexus of weaknesses, an impotent
Prince, a doubtful gentleman; and you yourself, indulgent
as you are, have twice reproved my levity. And shall I be
angry? I may feel the unkindness, but I have sufficient
honesty of mind to see the reasons of this <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From whom have you got this?&rdquo; she cried in wonder.
&ldquo;You think you have not behaved well? My Prince,
were you not young and handsome, I should detest you for
your virtues. You push them to the verge of commonplace.
And this ingratitude&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Understand me, Madame von Rosen,&rdquo; returned the
Prince, flushing a little darker, &ldquo;there can be here no talk
of gratitude, none of pride. You are here, by what circumstance
I know not, but doubtless led by your kindness,
mixed up in what regards my family alone. You have no
knowledge what my wife, your sovereign, may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147"></a>147</span>
suffered; it is not for you&mdash;no, nor for me&mdash;to judge. I
own myself in fault; and were it otherwise, a man were
a very empty boaster who should talk of love and start
before a small humiliation. It is in all the copybooks
that one should die to please his ladylove; and shall a
man not go to prison?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Love? And what has love to do with being sent to
gaol?&rdquo; exclaimed the Countess, appealing to the walls
and roof. &ldquo;Heaven knows I think as much of love as
any one; my life would prove it; but I admit no love, at
least for a man, that is not equally returned. The rest is
moonshine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think of love more absolutely, madam, though I am
certain no more tenderly, than a lady to whom I am indebted
for such kindnesses,&rdquo; returned the Prince. &ldquo;But
this is unavailing. We are not here to hold a court of
troubadours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;there is one thing you forget.
If she conspires with Gondremark against your liberty,
she may conspire with him against your honour also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My honour?&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;For a woman, you
surprise me. If I have failed to gain her love or play
my part of husband, what right is left me? or what honour
can remain in such a scene of defeat? No honour that I
recognise. I am become a stranger. If my wife no
longer loves me, I will go to prison, since she wills it; if
she love another, where should I be more in place? or
whose fault is it but mine? You speak, Madame von
Rosen, like too many women, with a man&rsquo;s tongue. Had
I myself fallen into temptation (as, Heaven knows, I
might) I should have trembled, but still hoped and asked for
her forgiveness; and yet mine had been a treason in the
teeth of love. But let me tell you, madam,&rdquo; he pursued,
with rising irritation, &ldquo;where a husband by futility, facility,
and ill-timed humours has outwearied his wife&rsquo;s patience,
I will suffer neither man nor woman to misjudge her.
She is free; the man has been found wanting.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page148"></a>148</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Because she loves you not?&rdquo; the Countess cried.
&ldquo;You know she is incapable of such a feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather, it was I who was born incapable of inspiring
it,&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>Madame von Rosen broke into sudden laughter. &ldquo;Fool,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;I am in love with you myself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam, you are most compassionate,&rdquo; the Prince
retorted, smiling. &ldquo;But this is waste debate. I know
my purpose. Perhaps, to equal you in frankness, I
know and embrace my advantage. I am not without
the spirit of adventure. I am in a false position&mdash;so
recognised by public acclamation: do you grudge me,
then, my issue?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your mind is made up, why should I dissuade you?&rdquo;
said the Countess. &ldquo;I own, with a bare face, I am the
gainer. Go, you take my heart with you, or more of it
than I desire; I shall not sleep at night for thinking of
your misery. But do not be afraid; I would not spoil you,
you are such a fool and hero.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! madam,&rdquo; cried the Prince, &ldquo;and your unlucky
money! I did amiss to take it, but you are a wonderful
persuader. And I thank God, I can still offer you the
fair equivalent.&rdquo; He took some papers from the chimney.
&ldquo;Here, madam, are the title-deeds,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;where I
am going, they can certainly be of no use to me, and I have
now no other hope of making up to you your kindness.
You made the loan without formality, obeying your kind
heart. The parts are somewhat changed; the sun of this
Prince of Gr√ºnewald is upon the point of setting; and I
know you better than to doubt you will once more waive
ceremony, and accept the best that he can give you. If I
may look for any pleasure in the coming time, it will be to
remember that the peasant is secure, and my most generous
friend no loser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you not understand my odious position?&rdquo; cried
the Countess. &ldquo;Dear Prince, it is upon your fall that I
begin my fortune.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page149"></a>149</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was the more like you to tempt me to resistance,&rdquo;
returned Otto. &ldquo;But this cannot alter our relations;
and I must, for the last time, lay my commands upon
you in the character of Prince.&rdquo; And with his loftiest
dignity, he forced the deeds on her acceptance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hate the very touch of them,&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>There followed upon this a little silence. &ldquo;At what
time,&rdquo; resumed Otto, &ldquo;(if indeed you know) am I to be
arrested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness, when you please!&rdquo; exclaimed the
Countess. &ldquo;Or, if you choose to tear that paper, never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather it were done quickly,&rdquo; said the Prince.
&ldquo;I shall take but time to leave a letter for the Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;I have advised you to
resist; at the same time, if you intend to be dumb before
your shearers, I must say that I ought to set about arranging
your arrest. I offered&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;&ldquo;I offered
to manage it, intending, my dear friend&mdash;intending, upon
my soul, to be of use to you. Well, if you will not profit
by my goodwill, then be of use to me; and as soon as ever
you feel ready, go to the Flying Mercury where we met last
night. It will be none the worse for you; and to make it
quite plain, it will be better for the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear madam, certainly,&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;If I am prepared
for the chief evil, I shall not quarrel with details.
Go, then, with my best gratitude; and when I have written
a few lines of leave-taking, I shall immediately hasten to
keep tryst. To-night I shall not meet so dangerous a
cavalier,&rdquo; he added, with a smiling gallantry.</p>

<p>As soon as Madame von Rosen was gone he made a
great call upon his self-command. He was face to face
with a miserable passage where, if it were possible, he desired
to carry himself with dignity. As to the main fact, he
never swerved or faltered; he had come so heart-sick and
so cruelly humiliated from his talk with Gotthold, that he
embraced the notion of imprisonment with something
bordering on relief. Here was, at least, a step which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page150"></a>150</span>
thought blameless; here was a way out of his troubles.
He sat down to write to Seraphina; and his anger blazed.
The tale of his forbearances mounted, in his eyes, to something
monstrous; still more monstrous, the coldness,
egoism, and cruelty that had required and thus requited
them. The pen which he had taken shook in his hand.
He was amazed to find his resignation fled, but it was
gone beyond his recall. In a few white-hot words, he
bade adieu, dubbing desperation by the name of love,
and calling his wrath forgiveness; then he cast but one
look of leave-taking on the place that had been his for so
long and was now to be his no longer; and hurried forth&mdash;love&rsquo;s
prisoner&mdash;or pride&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>He took that private passage which he had trodden so
often in less momentous hours. The porter let him out:
and the bountiful, cold air of the night and the pure glory
of the stars received him on the threshold. He looked
round him, breathing deep of earth&rsquo;s plain fragrance;
he looked up into the great array of heaven, and was
quieted. His little turgid life dwindled to its true proportions;
and he saw himself (that great flame-hearted
martyr!) stand like a speck under the cool cupola of the
night. Thus he felt his careless injuries already soothed;
the live air of out-of-doors, the quiet of the world, as if
by their silent music, sobering and dwarfing his emotions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I forgive her,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If it be of any use to
her, I forgive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And with brisk steps he crossed the garden, issued upon
the park, and came to the Flying Mercury. A dark figure
moved forward from the shadow of the pedestal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have to ask your pardon, sir,&rdquo; a voice observed,
&ldquo;but if I am right in taking you for the Prince, I was given
to understand that you would be prepared to meet me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr Gordon, I believe?&rdquo; said Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Herr Oberst Gordon,&rdquo; replied that officer. &ldquo;This is
rather a ticklish business for a man to be embarked in;
and to find that all is to go pleasantly is a great relief to me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151"></a>151</span>
The carriage is at hand; shall I have the honour of following
your Highness?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I have now come to that
happy moment of my life when I have orders to receive
but none to give.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most philosophical remark,&rdquo; returned the Colonel.
&ldquo;Begad, a very pertinent remark! it might be Plutarch.
I am not a drop&rsquo;s blood to your Highness, or indeed to
anyone in this principality; or else I should dislike my
orders. But as it is, and since there is nothing unnatural
or unbecoming on my side, and your Highness takes it
in good part, I begin to believe we may have a capital
time together, sir&mdash;a capital time. For a gaoler is only
a fellow-captive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I inquire, Herr Gordon,&rdquo; asked Otto, &ldquo;what
led you to accept this dangerous and I would fain hope
thankless office?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very natural, I am sure,&rdquo; replied the officer of fortune.
&ldquo;My pay is, in the meanwhile, doubled.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I will not presume to criticise,&rdquo; returned the
Prince. &ldquo;And I perceive the carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sure enough, at the intersection of two alleys of the
park, a coach and four, conspicuous by its lanterns, stood
in waiting. And a little way off about a score of lancers
were drawn up under the shadow of the trees.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h5>PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE THIRD
SHE ENLIGHTENS SERAPHINA</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">When</span> Madame von Rosen left the Prince, she hurried
straight to Colonel Gordon; and not content with directing
the arrangements, she had herself accompanied the
soldier of fortune to the Flying Mercury. The Colonel
gave her his arm, and the talk between this pair of conspirators
ran high and lively. The Countess, indeed, was
in a whirl of pleasure and excitement; her tongue stumbled
upon laughter, her eyes shone, the colour that was usually
wanting now perfected her face. It would have taken
little more to bring Gordon to her feet&mdash;or so, at least,
she believed, disdaining the idea.</p>

<p>Hidden among some lilac bushes, she enjoyed the great
decorum of the arrest, and heard the dialogue of the two
men die away along the path. Soon after, the rolling of a
carriage and the beat of hoofs arose in the still air of the
night, and passed speedily farther and fainter into silence.
The Prince was gone.</p>

<p>Madame von Rosen consulted her watch. She had
still, she thought, time enough for the tit-bit of her evening;
and hurrying to the palace, winged by the fear of Gondremark&rsquo;s
arrival, she sent her name and a pressing request
for a reception to the Princess Seraphina. As the Countess
von Rosen unqualified, she was sure to be refused; but
as an emissary of the Baron&rsquo;s, for so she chose to style
herself, she gained immediate entry.</p>

<p>The Princess sat alone at table, making a feint of dining.
Her cheeks were mottled, her eyes heavy; she had neither
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153"></a>153</span>
slept nor eaten; even her dress had been neglected. In
short, she was out of health, out of looks, out of heart, and
hag-ridden by her conscience. The Countess drew a swift
comparison, and shone brighter in beauty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You come, madam, <i>de la part de Monsieur le Baron</i>,&rdquo;
drawled the Princess. &ldquo;Be seated! What have you
to say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say?&rdquo; repeated Madame von Rosen. &ldquo;O, much
to say! Much to say that I would rather not, and much
to leave unsaid that I would rather say. For I am like
St. Paul, your Highness, and always wish to do the things
I should not. Well! to be categorical&mdash;that is the word?&mdash;I
took the Prince your order. He could not credit his
senses. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;dear Madame von Rosen, it is not
possible&mdash;it cannot be&mdash;I must hear it from your lips. My
wife is a poor girl misled, she is only silly, she is not cruel.&rsquo;
&rsquo;<i>Mon Prince</i>,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;a girl&mdash;and therefore cruel; youth
kills flies.&rsquo;&mdash;He had such pain to understand it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame von Rosen,&rdquo; said the Princess, in most
steadfast tones, but with a rose of anger in her face, &ldquo;who
sent you here, and for what purpose? Tell your errand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, madam, I believe you understand me very well,&rdquo;
returned von Rosen. &ldquo;I have not your philosophy. I
wear my heart upon my sleeve, excuse the indecency!
It is a very little one,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;and I so often change
the sleeve!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand the Prince has been arrested?&rdquo;
asked the Princess, rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While you sat there dining!&rdquo; cried the Countess,
still nonchalantly seated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have discharged your errand,&rdquo; was the reply;
&ldquo;I will not detain you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O no, madam,&rdquo; said the Countess, &ldquo;with your permission,
I have not yet done. I have borne much this
evening in your service. I have suffered. I was made to
suffer in your service.&rdquo; She unfolded her fan as she spoke.
Quick as her pulses beat, the fan waved languidly. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154"></a>154</span>
betrayed her emotion only by the brightness of her eyes
and face, and by the almost insolent triumph with which
she looked down upon the Princess. There were old scores
of rivalry between them in more than one field; so at
least von Rosen felt; and now she was to have her hour
of victory in them all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are no servant, Madame von Rosen, of mine,&rdquo;
said Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, madam, indeed,&rdquo; returned the Countess; &ldquo;but
we both serve the same person, as you know&mdash;or if you
do not, then I have the pleasure of informing you. Your
conduct is so light&mdash;so light,&rdquo; she repeated, the fan wavering
higher like a butterfly, &ldquo;that perhaps you do not truly
understand.&rdquo; The Countess rolled her fan together, laid
it in her lap, and rose to a less languorous position. &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo;
she continued, &ldquo;I should be sorry to see any young
woman in your situation. You began with every advantage&mdash;birth,
a suitable marriage&mdash;quite pretty too&mdash;and
see what you have come to! My poor girl! to think of it!
But there is nothing that does so much harm,&rdquo; observed
the Countess finely, &ldquo;as giddiness of mind.&rdquo; And she
once more unfurled the fan, and approvingly fanned
herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will no longer permit you to forget yourself,&rdquo; cried
Seraphina. &ldquo;I think you are mad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not mad,&rdquo; returned von Rosen. &ldquo;Sane enough to
know you dare not break with me to-night, and to profit
by the knowledge. I left my poor, pretty Prince Charming
crying his eyes out for a wooden doll. My heart is soft;
I love my pretty Prince; you will never understand it,
but I long to give my Prince his doll, dry his poor eyes, and
send him off happy. O, you immature fool!&rdquo; the Countess
cried, rising to her feet, and pointing at the Princess the
closed fan that now began to tremble in her hand. &ldquo;O
wooden doll!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;have you a heart, or blood, or
any nature? This is a man, child&mdash;a man who loves you.
O, it will not happen twice! it is not common; beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155"></a>155</span>
and clever women look in vain for it. And you, you
pitiful school-girl, tread this jewel under foot! you,
stupid with your vanity! Before you try to govern
kingdoms you should first be able to behave yourself at
home; home is the woman&rsquo;s kingdom.&rdquo; She paused and
laughed a little, strangely to hear and look upon. &ldquo;I will
tell you one of the things,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that were to stay
unspoken. Von Rosen is a better woman than you, my
Princess, though you will never have the pain of understanding
it; and when I took the Prince your order, and
looked upon his face, my soul was melted&mdash;O, I am frank&mdash;here,
within my arms, I offered him repose!&rdquo; She advanced
a step superbly as she spoke, with outstretched
arms; and Seraphina shrank. &ldquo;Do not be alarmed!&rdquo;
the Countess cried; &ldquo;I am not offering that hermitage to
you; in all the world there is but one who wants to, and
him you have dismissed! &lsquo;If it will give her pleasure I
should wear the martyr&rsquo;s crown,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;I will embrace
the thorns.&rsquo; I tell you&mdash;I am quite frank&mdash;I put the order
in his power and begged him to resist. You, who have
betrayed your husband, may betray me to Gondremark;
my Prince would betray no one. Understand it plainly,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis of his pure forbearance you sit there;
he had the power&mdash;I gave it him&mdash;to change the parts;
and he refused, and went to prison in your place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Princess spoke with some distress. &ldquo;Your violence
shocks me and pains me,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;but I cannot be
angry with what at least does honour to the mistaken kindness
of your heart: it was right for me to know this.
I will condescend to tell you. It was with deep regret
that I was driven to this step. I admire in many ways
the Prince&mdash;I admit his amiability. It was our great
misfortune, it was perhaps somewhat of my fault, that we
were so unsuited to each other; but I have a regard, a
sincere regard, for all his qualities. As a private person
I should think as you do. It is difficult, I know, to make
allowances for state considerations. I have only with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156"></a>156</span>
deep reluctance obeyed the call of a superior duty; and so
soon as I dare do it for the safety of the state, I promise you
the Prince shall be released. Many in my situation would
have resented your freedoms. I am not&rdquo;&mdash;and she looked
for a moment rather piteously upon the Countess&mdash;&ldquo;I
am not altogether so inhuman as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you can put these troubles of the state,&rdquo; the
Countess cried, &ldquo;to weigh with a man&rsquo;s love?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame von Rosen, these troubles are affairs of
life and death to many; to the Prince, and perhaps even
to yourself, among the number,&rdquo; replied the Princess,
with dignity. &ldquo;I have learned, madam, although still
so young, in a hard school, that my own feelings must
everywhere come last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O callow innocence!&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;Is
it possible you do not know, or do not suspect, the intrigue
in which you move? I find it in my heart to pity you!
We are both women after all&mdash;poor girl, poor girl!&mdash;and
who is born a woman is born a fool. And though I hate all
women&mdash;come, for the common folly, I forgive you. Your
Highness&rdquo;&mdash;she dropped a deep stage curtsey and resumed
her fan&mdash;&ldquo;I am going to insult you, to betray one
who is called my lover, and, if it pleases you to use the
power I now put unreservedly into your hands, to ruin
my dear self. O what a French comedy! You betray,
I betray, they betray. It is now my cue. The letter, yes.
Behold the letter, madam, its seal unbroken as I found it
by my bed this morning; for I was out of humour, and
I get many, too many, of these favours. For your own
sake, for the sake of my Prince Charming, for the sake
of this great principality that sits so heavy on your conscience,
open it and read!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; inquired the Princess, &ldquo;that
this letter in any way regards me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see I have not opened it,&rdquo; replied von Rosen;
&ldquo;but &rsquo;tis mine, and I beg you to experiment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cannot look at it till you have,&rdquo; returned Seraphina,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"></a>157</span>
very seriously. &ldquo;There may be matter there not meant
for me to see; it is a private letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess tore it open, glanced it through, and
tossed it back; and the Princess, taking up the sheet,
recognised the hand of Gondremark, and read with a
sickening shock the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Dearest Anna, come at once. Ratafia has done the deed,
her husband is to be packed to prison. This puts the minx entirely
in my power; <i>le tour est jou√©</i>; she will now go steady in harness,
or I will know the reason why. Come.</p>

<p class="sc rt">&ldquo;Heinrich.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Command yourself, madam,&rdquo; said the Countess,
watching with some alarm the white face of Seraphina.
&ldquo;It is in vain for you to fight with Gondremark; he has
more strings than mere court favour, and could bring you
down to-morrow with a word. I would not have betrayed
him otherwise; but Heinrich is a man, and plays with all
of you like marionettes. And now at least you see for
what you sacrificed my Prince. Madam, will you take
some wine? I have been cruel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not cruel, madam&mdash;salutary,&rdquo; said Seraphina, with
a phantom smile. &ldquo;No, I thank you, I require no attentions.
The first surprise affected me: will you give me
time a little? I must think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She took her head between her hands and contemplated
for a while the hurricane confusion of her thoughts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This information reaches me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;when I
have need of it. I would not do as you have done, but
yet I thank you. I have been much deceived in Baron
Gondremark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, madam, leave Gondremark, and think upon the
Prince!&rdquo; cried von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You speak once more as a private person,&rdquo; said the
Princess; &ldquo;nor do I blame you. But my own thoughts
are more distracted. However, as I believe you are truly
a friend to my&mdash;to the&mdash;&mdash;as I believe,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158"></a>158</span>
are a friend to Otto, I shall put the order for his release
into your hands this moment. Give me the ink-dish.
There!&rdquo; And she wrote hastily, steadying her arm
upon the table, for she trembled like a reed. &ldquo;Remember,
madam,&rdquo; she resumed, handing her the order, &ldquo;this must
not be used nor spoken of at present; till I have seen the
Baron, any hurried step&mdash;I lose myself in thinking. The
suddenness has shaken me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I promise you I will not use it,&rdquo; said the Countess,
&ldquo;till you give me leave, although I wish the Prince could
be informed of it, to comfort his poor heart. And O, I
had forgotten, he has left a letter. Suffer me, madam;
I will bring it you. This is the door, I think?&rdquo; And
she sought to open it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bolt is pushed,&rdquo; said Seraphina, flushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O! O!&rdquo; cried the Countess.</p>

<p>A silence fell between them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will get it for myself,&rdquo; said Seraphina; &ldquo;and in
the meanwhile I beg you to leave me. I thank you, I
am sure, but I shall be obliged if you will leave me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess deeply curtseyed, and withdrew.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h5>RELATES THE CAUSE AND OUTBREAK OF THE
REVOLUTION</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Brave</span> as she was, and brave by intellect, the Princess,
when first she was alone, clung to the table for support.
The four corners of her universe had fallen. She had
never liked nor trusted Gondremark completely; she had
still held it possible to find him false to friendship; but
from that to finding him devoid of all those public virtues
for which she had honoured him, a mere commonplace
intriguer, using her for his own ends, the step was wide
and the descent giddy. Light and darkness succeeded
each other in her brain; now she believed, and now she
could not. She turned, blindly groping for the note.
But von Rosen, who had not forgotten to take the warrant
from the Prince, had remembered to recover her note
from the Princess: von Rosen was an old campaigner,
whose most violent emotion aroused rather than clouded
the vigour of her reason.</p>

<p>The thought recalled to Seraphina the remembrance
of the other letter&mdash;Otto&rsquo;s. She rose and went speedily,
her brain still wheeling, and burst into the Prince&rsquo;s
armoury. The old chamberlain was there in waiting;
and the sight of another face, prying (or so she felt) on
her distress, struck Seraphina into childish anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; she cried; and then, when the old man was
already half-way to the door, &ldquo;Stay!&rdquo; she added. &ldquo;As
soon as Baron Gondremark arrives, let him attend me
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It shall be so directed,&rdquo; said the chamberlain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"></a>160</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There was a letter ...&rdquo; she began, and paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Her Highness,&rdquo; said the chamberlain, &ldquo;will find a
letter on the table. I had received no orders, or her
Highness had been spared this trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I thank you. I desire to
be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, when he was gone, she leaped upon the letter.
Her mind was still obscured; like the moon upon a night
of clouds and wind, her reason shone and was darkened,
and she read the words by flashes.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Seraphina,&rdquo; the Prince wrote, &ldquo;I will write no syllable of
reproach. I have seen your order, and I go. What else is left
me? I have wasted my love, and have no more. To say that I
forgive you is not needful: at least, we are now separate for ever;
by your own act, you free me from my willing bondage: I go free
to prison. This is the last that you will hear of me in love or anger.
I have gone out of your life; you may breathe easy; you have
now rid yourself of the husband who allowed you to desert him,
of the Prince who gave you his rights, and of the married lover
who made it his pride to defend you in your absence. How you
have requited him, your own heart more loudly tells you than my
words. There is a day coming when your vain dreams will roll
away like clouds, and you will find yourself alone. Then you will
remember</p>

<p class="sc rt">&ldquo;Otto.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>She read with a great horror on her mind; that day, of
which he wrote, was come. She was alone; she had been
false, she had been cruel; remorse rolled in upon her;
and then with a more piercing note, vanity bounded on
the stage of consciousness. She a dupe! she helpless!
she to have betrayed herself in seeking to betray her
husband! she to have lived these years upon flattery,
grossly swallowing the bolus, like a clown with sharpers!
she&mdash;Seraphina! Her swift mind drank the consequences;
she foresaw the coming fall, her public shame; she saw
the odium, disgrace, and folly of her story flaunt through
Europe. She recalled the scandal she had so royally
braved; and, alas! she had now no courage to confront
it with. To be thought the mistress of that man: perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161"></a>161</span>
for that.... She closed her eyes on agonising vistas.
Swift as thought she had snatched a bright dagger from
the weapons that shone along the wall. Ay, she would
escape. From that world-wide theatre of nodding heads
and buzzing whisperers, in which she now beheld herself
unpitiably martyred, one door stood open. At any cost,
through any stress of suffering, that greasy laughter
should be stifled. She closed her eyes, breathed a wordless
prayer, and pressed the weapon to her bosom.</p>

<p>At the astonishing sharpness of the prick, she gave a
cry and awoke to a sense of undeserved escape. A little
ruby spot of blood was the reward of that great act of
desperation; but the pain had braced her like a tonic, and
her whole design of suicide had passed away.</p>

<p>At the same instant regular feet drew near along the
gallery, and she knew the tread of the big Baron, so often
gladly welcome, and even now rallying her spirits like a
call to battle. She concealed the dagger in the folds of
her skirt; and drawing her stature up, she stood firm-footed,
radiant with anger, waiting for the foe.</p>

<p>The Baron was announced, and entered. To him,
Seraphina was a hated task: like the schoolboy with his
Virgil, he had neither will nor leisure to remark her beauties;
but when he now beheld her standing illuminated by her
passion, new feelings flashed upon him, a frank admiration,
a brief sparkle of desire. He noted both with joy; they
were means. &ldquo;If I have to play the lover,&rdquo; thought he,
for that was his constant preoccupation, &ldquo;I believe I can
put soul into it.&rdquo; Meanwhile, with his usual ponderous
grace, he bent before the lady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I propose,&rdquo; she said in a strange voice, not known
to her till then, &ldquo;that we release the Prince and do not
prosecute the war.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis as I knew it would be!
Your heart, I knew, would wound you when we came to
this distasteful but most necessary step. Ah, madam,
believe me, I am not unworthy to be your ally; I know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162"></a>162</span>
you have qualities to which I am a stranger, and count
them the best weapons in the armoury of our alliance:&mdash;the
girl in the queen&mdash;pity, love, tenderness, laughter;
the smile that can reward. I can only command; I am
the frowner. But you! And you have the fortitude to
command these comely weaknesses, to tread them down
at the call of reason. How often have I not admired it
even to yourself! Ay, even to yourself,&rdquo; he added tenderly,
dwelling, it seemed, in memory on hours of more private
admiration. &ldquo;But now, madam&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But now, Herr von Gondremark, the time for these
declarations has gone by,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Are you true to
me? are you false? Look in your heart and answer:
it is your heart I want to know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has come,&rdquo; thought Gondremark. &ldquo;You,
madam!&rdquo; he cried, starting back&mdash;with fear, you would
have said, and yet a timid joy. &ldquo;You! yourself, you
bid me look into my heart?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I fear?&rdquo; she cried, and looked at him
with such a heightened colour, such bright eyes, and a
smile of so abstruse a meaning that the Baron discarded
his last doubt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam!&rdquo; he cried, plumping on his knees.
&ldquo;Seraphina! Do you permit me? have you divined my
secret? It is true&mdash;I put my life with joy into your
power&mdash;I love you, love with ardour, as an equal, as a
mistress, as a brother-in-arms, as an adored, desired,
sweet-hearted woman. O Bride!&rdquo; he cried, waxing
dithyrambic, &ldquo;bride of my reason and my senses, have
pity, have pity on my love!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She heard him with wonder, rage, and then contempt.
His words offended her to sickness; his appearance, as
he grovelled bulkily upon the floor, moved her to such
laughter as we laugh in nightmares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O shame!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Absurd and odious! What
would the Countess say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>That great Baron Gondremark, the excellent politician,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163"></a>163</span>
remained for some little time upon his knees in a frame of
mind which perhaps we are allowed to pity. His vanity,
within his iron bosom, bled and raved. If he could have
blotted all, if he could have withdrawn part, if he had
not called her bride&mdash;with a roaring in his ears, he thus
regretfully reviewed his declaration. He got to his feet
tottering; and then, in that first moment when a dumb
agony finds a vent in words, and the tongue betrays the
inmost and worst of a man, he permitted himself a retort
which, for six weeks to follow, he was to repent at leisure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Countess? Now I perceive the
reason of your Highness&rsquo;s disorder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lackey-like insolence of the words was driven home
by a more insolent manner. There fell upon Seraphina
one of those storm-clouds which had already blackened
upon her reason; she heard herself cry out; and when the
cloud dispersed, flung the blood-stained dagger on the
floor, and saw Gondremark reeling back with open mouth
and clapping his hand upon the wound. The next moment,
with oaths that she had never heard, he leaped at her in
savage passion; clutched her as she recoiled; and in the
very act, stumbled and drooped. She had scarce time to
fear his murderous onslaught ere he fell before her feet.</p>

<p>He rose upon one elbow; she still staring upon him,
white with horror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anna!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Anna! Help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then his utterance failed him, and he fell back, to
all appearance dead.</p>

<p>Seraphina ran to and fro in the room; she wrung her
hands and cried aloud; within she was all one uproar of
terror, and conscious of no articulate wish but to awake.</p>

<p>There came a knocking at the door; and she sprang
to it and held it, panting like a beast, and with the strength
of madness in her arms, till she had pushed the bolt. At
this success a certain calm fell upon her reason. She went
back and looked upon her victim, the knocking growing
louder. O yes, he was dead. She had killed him. He had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164"></a>164</span>
called upon von Rosen with his latest breath; ah! who
would call on Seraphina? She had killed him. She,
whose irresolute hand could scarce prick blood from her
own bosom, had found strength to cast down that great
colossus at a blow.</p>

<p>All this while the knocking was growing more uproarious
and more unlike the staid career of life in such a palace.
Scandal was at the door, with what a fatal following she
dreaded to conceive; and at the same time among the
voices that now began to summon her by name, she recognised
the Chancellor&rsquo;s. He or another, somebody
must be the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Herr von Greisengesang without?&rdquo; she called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness&mdash;yes!&rdquo; the old gentleman answered.
&ldquo;We have heard cries, a fall. Is anything amiss?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; replied Seraphina. &ldquo;I desire to speak
with you. Send off the rest.&rdquo; She panted between each
phrase; but her mind was clear. She let the looped curtain
down upon both sides before she drew the bolt; and, thus
secure from any sudden eyeshot from without, admitted
the obsequious Chancellor, and again made fast the
door.</p>

<p>Greisengesang clumsily revolved among the wings of
the curtain; so that she was clear of it as soon as he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The Baron!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have killed him,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;O, killed him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;this is most unprecedented.
Lovers&rsquo; quarrels,&rdquo; he added ruefully,
&ldquo;redintegratio&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and then paused. &ldquo;But, my dear
madam,&rdquo; he broke out again, &ldquo;in the name of all that is
practical, what are we to do? This is exceedingly grave;
morally, madam, it is appalling. I take the liberty, your
Highness, for one moment, of addressing you as a daughter,
a loved although respected daughter; and I must say that I
cannot conceal from you that this is morally most questionable.
And, O dear me, we have a dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She had watched him closely; hope fell to contempt;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165"></a>165</span>
she drew away her skirts from his weakness, and, in the
act, her own strength returned to her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See if he be dead,&rdquo; she said; not one word of explanation
or defence; she had scorned to justify herself
before so poor a creature: &ldquo;See if he be dead&rdquo; was all.</p>

<p>With the greatest compunction, the Chancellor drew
near; and as he did so the wounded Baron rolled his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He lives,&rdquo; cried the old courtier, turning effusively to
Seraphina. &ldquo;Madam, he still lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help him, then,&rdquo; returned the Princess, standing
fixed. &ldquo;Bind up his wound.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam, I have no means,&rdquo; protested the Chancellor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you not take your handkerchief, your neckcloth,
anything?&rdquo; she cried; and at the same moment, from
her light muslin gown she rent off a flounce and tossed it
on the floor. &ldquo;Take that,&rdquo; she said, and for the first
time directly faced Greisengesang.</p>

<p>But the Chancellor held up his hands and turned away
his head in agony. The grasp of the falling Baron had
torn down the dainty fabric of the bodice; and&mdash;&ldquo;O
Highness!&rdquo; cried Greisengesang, appalled, &ldquo;the terrible
disorder of your toilette!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take up that flounce,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the man may die.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Greisengesang turned in a flutter to the Baron, and
attempted some innocent and bungling measures. &ldquo;He
still breathes,&rdquo; he kept saying. &ldquo;All is not yet over;
he is not yet gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;if that is all you can do, begone
and get some porters; he must instantly go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; cried the Chancellor, &ldquo;if this most melancholy
sight was seen in town&mdash;O dear, the state would
fall!&rdquo; he piped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is a litter in the palace,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;It is
your part to see him safe. I lay commands upon you.
On your life it stands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see it, dear Highness,&rdquo; he jerked. &ldquo;Clearly I
see it. But how? what men? The Prince&rsquo;s servants&mdash;yes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166"></a>166</span>
They had a personal affection. They will be true,
if any.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, not them!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Take Sabra, my own
man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sabra! The grand-mason?&rdquo; returned the Chancellor,
aghast. &ldquo;If he but saw this, he would sound the
tocsin&mdash;we should all be butchered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She measured the depth of her abasement steadily.
&ldquo;Take whom you must,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and bring the litter
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once she was alone she ran to the Baron, and with a
sickening heart sought to allay the flux of blood. The
touch of the skin of that great charlatan revolted her to
the toes; the wound, in her ignorant eyes, looked deathly;
yet she contended with her shuddering, and, with more
skill at least than the Chancellor&rsquo;s, staunched the welling
injury. An eye unprejudiced with hate would have
admired the Baron in his swoon; he looked so great and
shapely; it was so powerful a machine that lay arrested;
and his features, cleared for the moment both of temper and
dissimulation, were seen to be so purely modelled. But
it was not thus with Seraphina. Her victim, as he lay
outspread, twitching a little, his big chest unbared, fixed
her with his ugliness; and her mind flitted for a glimpse
to Otto.</p>

<p>Rumours began to sound about the palace of feet running
and of voices raised; the echoes of the great arched staircase
were voluble of some confusion; and then the gallery
jarred with a quick and heavy tramp. It was the
Chancellor, followed by four of Otto&rsquo;s valets and a litter.
The servants, when they were admitted, stared at the dishevelled
Princess and the wounded man; speech was
denied them, but their thoughts were riddled with profanity.
Gondremark was bundled in; the curtains of the
litter were lowered; the bearers carried it forth, and the
Chancellor followed behind with a white face.</p>

<p>Seraphina ran to the window. Pressing her face upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167"></a>167</span>
the pane, she could see the terrace, where the lights contended;
thence, the avenue of lamps that joined the
palace and town; and overhead the hollow night and the
larger stars. Presently the small procession issued from
the palace, crossed the parade, and began to thread the
glittering alley: the swinging couch with its four porters,
the much-pondering Chancellor behind. She watched
them dwindle with strange thoughts: her eyes fixed upon
the scene, her mind still glancing right and left on the
overthrow of her life and hopes. There was no one left
in whom she might confide; none whose hand was friendly,
or on whom she dared to reckon for the barest loyalty.
With the fall of Gondremark, her party, her brief popularity,
had fallen. So she sat crouched upon the window-seat, her
brow to the cool pane; her dress in tatters, barely shielding
her; her mind revolving bitter thoughts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, consequences were fast mounting; and in
the deceptive quiet of the night, downfall and red revolt
were brewing. The litter had passed forth between the
iron gates and entered on the streets of the town. By
what flying panic, by what thrill of air communicated, who
shall say? but the passing bustle in the palace had already
reached and re-echoed in the region of the burghers.
Rumour, with her loud whisper, hissed about the town;
men left their homes without knowing why; knots formed
along the boulevard; under the rare lamps and the great
limes the crowd grew blacker.</p>

<p>And now through the midst of that expectant company,
the unusual sight of a closed litter was observed approaching,
and trotting hard behind it that great dignitary
Cancellarius Greisengesang. Silence looked on as it went
by; and as soon as it was passed, the whispering seethed
over like a boiling pot. The knots were sundered; and
gradually, one following another, the whole mob began
to form into a procession and escort the curtained litter.
Soon spokesmen, a little bolder than their mates, began
to ply the Chancellor with questions. Never had he more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168"></a>168</span>
need of that great art of falsehood, by whose exercise he
had so richly lived. And yet now he stumbled, the master
passion, fear, betraying him. He was pressed; he became
incoherent; and then from the jolting litter came a groan.
In the instant hubbub and the gathering of the crowd as
to a natural signal, the clear-eyed, quavering Chancellor
heard the catch of the clock before it strikes the hour of
doom; and for ten seconds he forgot himself. This shall
atone for many sins. He plucked a bearer by the sleeve.
&ldquo;Bid the Princess flee. All is lost,&rdquo; he whispered. And
the next moment he was babbling for his life among the
multitude.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the wild-eyed servant burst into
the armoury. &ldquo;All is lost!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The Chancellor
bids you flee.&rdquo; And at the same time, looking through
the window, Seraphina saw the black rush of the populace
begin to invade the lamplit avenue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Georg,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thank you. Go.&rdquo;
And as the man still lingered, &ldquo;I bid you go,&rdquo; she added.
&ldquo;Save yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Down by the private passage, and just some two hours
later, Amalia Seraphina, the last Princess, followed Otto
Johann Friedrich, the last Prince of Gr√ºnewald.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>PRINCESS CINDERELLA</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> porter, drawn by the growing turmoil, had vanished
from the postern, and the door stood open on the darkness
of the night. As Seraphina fled up the terraces, the cries
and loud footing of the mob drew nearer the doomed
palace; the rush was like the rush of cavalry; the sound
of shattering lamps tingled above the rest; and, over-towering
all, she heard her own name bandied among the
shouters. A bugle sounded at the door of the guard-room;
one gun was fired; and then, with the yell of hundreds,
Mittwalden Palace was carried at a rush.</p>

<p>Sped by these dire sounds and voices, the Princess
scaled the long garden, skimming like a bird the star-lit
stairways; crossed the park, which was in that place
narrow; and plunged upon the farther side into the rude
shelter of the forest. So, at a bound, she left the discretion
and the cheerful lamps of palace evenings; ceased
utterly to be a sovereign lady; and, falling from the whole
height of civilisation, ran forth into the woods, a ragged
Cinderella.</p>

<p>She went direct before her through an open tract of the
forest, full of brush and birches, and where the starlight
guided her; and, beyond that again, must thread the
columned blackness of a pine grove joining overhead the
thatch of its long branches. At that hour the place was
breathless; a horror of night like a presence occupied
that dungeon of the wood; and she went groping, knocking
against the boles&mdash;her ear, betweenwhiles, strained to
aching and yet unrewarded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page172"></a>172</span></p>

<p>But the slope of the ground was upward, and encouraged
her; and presently she issued on a rocky hill that stood
forth above the sea of forest. All around were other
hill-tops, big and little; sable vales of forest between;
overhead the open heaven and the brilliancy of countless
stars; and along the western sky the dim forms of mountains.
The glory of the great night laid hold upon her;
her eyes shone with stars; she dipped her sight into the
coolness and brightness of the sky, as she might have
dipped her wrist into a spring; and her heart, at that
ethereal shock, began to move more soberly. The sun
that sails overhead, ploughing into gold the fields of daylight
azure and uttering the signal to man&rsquo;s myriads, has no
word apart for man the individual; and the moon, like
a violin, only praises and laments our private destiny. The
stars alone, cheerful whisperers, confer quietly with each
of us like friends; they give ear to our sorrows smilingly,
like wise old men, rich in tolerance; and by their double
scale, so small to the eye, so vast to the imagination, they
keep before the mind the double character of man&rsquo;s nature
and fate.</p>

<p>There sat the Princess, beautifully looking upon beauty,
in council with these glad advisers. Bright like pictures,
clear like a voice in the porches of her ear, memory re-enacted
the tumult of the evening: the Countess and the
dancing fan, the big Baron on his knees, the blood on the
polished floor, the knocking, the swing of the litter down
the avenue of lamps, the messenger, the cries of the charging
mob; and yet all were far away and phantasmal, and she
was still healingly conscious of the peace and glory of the
night. She looked towards Mittwalden; and above the
hill-top, which already hid it from her view, a throbbing redness
hinted of fire. Better so: better so, that she should
fall with tragic greatness, lit by a blazing palace! She
felt not a trace of pity for Gondremark or of concern for
Gr√ºnewald: that period of her life was closed for ever, a
wrench of wounded vanity alone surviving. She had but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"></a>173</span>
one clear idea: to flee;&mdash;and another, obscure and half-rejected,
although still obeyed: to flee in the direction of
the Felsenburg. She had a duty to perform, she must free
Otto&mdash;so her mind said, very coldly; but her heart embraced
the notion of that duty even with ardour, and her
hands began to yearn for the grasp of kindness.</p>

<p>She rose, with a start of recollection, and plunged down
the slope into the covert. The woods received and closed
upon her. Once more, she wandered and hasted in a blot,
uncheered, unpiloted. Here and there, indeed, through
rents in the wood-roof, a glimmer attracted her; here
and there a tree stood out among its neighbours by some
force of outline; here and there a brushing among the
leaves, a notable blackness, a dim shine, relieved, only to
exaggerate, the solid oppression of the night and silence.
And betweenwhiles, the unfeatured darkness would redouble
and the whole ear of night appear to be gloating on
her steps. Now she would stand still, and the silence would
grow and grow, till it weighed upon her breathing; and
then she would address herself again to run, stumbling,
falling, and still hurrying the more. And presently the
whole wood rocked and began to run along with her. The
noise of her own mad passage through the silence spread and
echoed, and filled the night with terror. Panic hunted
her: Panic from the trees reached forth with clutching
branches; the darkness was lit up and peopled with
strange forms and faces. She strangled and fled before
her fears. And yet in the last fortress, reason, blown
upon by these gusts of terror, still shone with a troubled
light. She knew, yet could not act upon her knowledge;
she knew that she must stop, and yet she still ran.</p>

<p>She was already near madness, when she broke suddenly
into a narrow clearing. At the same time the din grew
louder, and she became conscious of vague forms and fields
of whiteness. And with that the earth gave way; she fell
and found her feet again with an incredible shock to her
senses, and her mind was swallowed up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page174"></a>174</span></p>

<p>When she came again to herself she was standing to
the mid-leg in an icy eddy of a brook, and leaning with
one hand on the rock from which it poured. The spray
had wet her hair. She saw the white cascade, the stars
wavering in the shaken pool, foam flitting, and high overhead
the tall pines on either hand serenely drinking star-shine;
and in the sudden quiet of her spirit she heard with
joy the firm plunge of the cataract in the pool. She
scrambled forth dripping. In the face of her proved
weakness, to adventure again upon the horror of blackness
in the groves were a suicide of life or reason. But here,
in the alley of the brook, with the kind stars above her,
and the moon presently swimming into sight, she could
await the coming of day without alarm.</p>

<p>This lane of pine-trees ran very rapidly down hill and
wound among the woods; but it was a wider thoroughfare
than the brook needed, and here and there were little
dimpling lawns and coves of the forest, where the starshine
slumbered. Such a lawn she paced, taking patience
bravely; and now she looked up the hill and saw the
brook coming down to her in a series of cascades; and
now approached the margin, where it welled among the
rushes silently; and now gazed at the great company of
heaven with an enduring wonder. The early evening had
fallen chill, but the night was now temperate; out of the
recesses of the wood there came mild airs as from a deep
and peaceful breathing; and the dew was heavy on the
grass and the tight-shut daisies. This was the girl&rsquo;s first
night under the naked heaven; and now that her fears
were overpast, she was touched to the soul by its serene
amenity and peace. Kindly the host of heaven blinked
down upon that wandering Princess; and the honest
brook had no words but to encourage her.</p>

<p>At last she began to be aware of a wonderful revolution,
compared to which the fire of Mittwalden Palace was but
the crack and flash of a percussion-cap. The countenance
with which the pines regarded her began insensibly to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"></a>175</span>
change; the grass too, short as it was, and the whole
winding staircase of the brook&rsquo;s course, began to wear
a solemn freshness of appearance. And this slow transfiguration
reached her heart, and played upon it, and
transpierced it with a serious thrill. She looked all about;
the whole face of nature looked back, brimful of meaning,
finger on lip, leaking its glad secret. She looked up.
Heaven was almost emptied of stars. Such as still lingered
shone with a changed and waning brightness, and began
to faint in their stations. And the colour of the sky
itself was the most wonderful; for the rich blue of the night
had now melted and softened and brightened; and there
had succeeded in its place a hue that has no name, and
that is never seen but as the herald of morning. &ldquo;O!&rdquo;
she cried, joy catching at her voice, &ldquo;O! it is the dawn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a breath she passed over the brook, and looped up
her skirts and fairly ran in the dim alleys. As she ran,
her ears were aware of many pipings, more beautiful than
music; in the small dish-shaped houses in the fork of
giant arms, where they had lain all night, lover by lover,
warmly pressed, the bright-eyed, big-hearted singers began
to awaken for the day. Her heart melted and flowed
forth to them in kindness. And they, from their small and
high perches in the clerestories of the wood cathedral,
peered down sidelong at the ragged Princess as she flitted
below them on the carpet of the moss and tassel.</p>

<p>Soon she had struggled to a certain hill-top, and saw
far before her the silent inflooding of the day. Out of the
East it welled and whitened; the darkness trembled into
light; and the stars were extinguished like the street-lamps
of a human city. The whiteness brightened into
silver, the silver warmed into gold, the gold kindled into
pure and living fire; and the face of the East was barred
with elemental scarlet. The day drew its first long breath,
steady and chill; and for leagues around the woods sighed
and shivered. And then, at one bound, the sun had
floated up; and her startled eyes received day&rsquo;s first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"></a>176</span>
arrow, and quailed under the buffet. On every side, the
shadows leaped from their ambush and fell prone. The
day was come, plain and garish; and up the steep and
solitary eastern heaven, the sun, victorious over his competitors,
continued slowly and royally to mount.</p>

<p>Seraphina drooped for a little, leaning on a pine, the
shrill joy of the woodlands mocking her. The shelter of
the night, the thrilling and joyous changes of the dawn,
were over; and now, in the hot eye of the day, she turned
uneasily and looked sighingly about her. Some way off
among the lower woods a pillar of smoke was mounting
and melting in the gold and blue. There, surely enough,
were human folk, the hearth-surrounders. Man&rsquo;s fingers
had laid the twigs; it was man&rsquo;s breath that had quickened
and encouraged the baby flames; and now, as the fire
caught, it would be playing ruddily on the face of its
creator. At the thought, she felt a-cold and little and
lost in that great out-of-doors. The electric shock of the
young sunbeams and the unhuman beauty of the woods
began to irk and daunt her. The covert of the house, the
decent privacy of rooms, the swept and regulated fire, all
that denotes or beautifies the home life of man, began
to draw her as with cords. The pillar of smoke was now
risen into some stream of moving air; it began to lean out
sideways in a pennon; and thereupon, as though the
change had been a summons, Seraphina plunged once more
into the labyrinth of the wood.</p>

<p>She left day upon the high ground. In the lower groves
there still lingered the blue early twilight and the seizing
freshness of the dew. But here and there, above this
field of shadow, the head of a great outspread pine was
already glorious with day; and here and there, through
the breaches of the hills, the sunbeams made a great and
luminous entry. Here Seraphina hastened along forest
paths. She had lost sight of the pilot smoke, which blew
another way, and conducted herself in that great wilderness
by the direction of the sun. But presently fresh signs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177"></a>177</span>
bespoke the neighbourhood of man; felled trunks, white
slivers from the axe, bundles of green boughs, and stacks of
firewood. These guided her forward; until she came
forth at last upon the clearing whence the smoke arose.
A hut stood in the clear shadow, hard by a brook which
made a series of inconsiderable falls; and on the threshold
the Princess saw a sun-burnt and hard-featured woodman,
standing with his hands behind his back and gazing sky-ward.</p>

<p>She went to him directly; a beautiful, bright-eyed,
and haggard vision; splendidly arrayed and pitifully
tattered; the diamond ear-drops still glittering in her
ears; and with the movement of her coming, one small
breast showing and hiding among the ragged covert of
the laces. At that ambiguous hour, and coming as she
did from the great silence of the forest, the man drew back
from the Princess as from something elfin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am cold,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and weary. Let me rest
beside your fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The woodman was visibly commoved, but answered
nothing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pay,&rdquo; she said, and then repented of the words,
catching perhaps a spark of terror from his frightened
eyes. But, as usual, her courage rekindled brighter for
the check. She put him from the door and entered;
and he followed her in superstitious wonder.</p>

<p>Within, the hut was rough and dark; but on the stone
that served as hearth, twigs and a few dry branches burned
with the brisk sounds and all the variable beauty of fire.
The very sight of it composed her; she crouched hard by
on the earth floor and shivered in the glow, and looked
upon the eating blaze with admiration. The woodman
was still staring at his guest; at the wreck of the rich
dress, the bare arms, the bedraggled laces and the gems.
He found no word to utter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give me food,&rdquo; said she,&mdash;&ldquo;here, by the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He set down a pitcher of coarse wine, bread, a piece of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178"></a>178</span>
cheese, and a handful of raw onions. The bread was hard
and sour, the cheese like leather; even the onion, which
ranks with the truffle and the nectarine in the chief place of
honour of earth&rsquo;s fruits, is not perhaps a dish for princesses
when raw. But she ate, if not with appetite, with courage;
and when she had eaten, did not disdain the pitcher. In
all her life before, she had not tasted of gross food nor
drunk after another; but a brave woman far more readily
accepts a change of circumstances than the bravest man.
All that while, the woodman continued to observe her
furtively, many low thoughts of fear and greed contending
in his eyes. She read them clearly, and she knew she
must be gone.</p>

<p>Presently she arose and offered him a florin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will that repay you?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>But here the man found his tongue. &ldquo;I must have
more than that,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all I have to give you,&rdquo; she returned, and passed
him by serenely.</p>

<p>Yet her heart trembled, for she saw his hand stretched
forth as if to arrest her, and his unsteady eyes wandering
to his axe. A beaten path led westward from the clearing,
and she swiftly followed it. She did not glance behind
her. But as soon as the least turning of the path had
concealed her from the woodman&rsquo;s eyes, she slipped among
the trees and ran till she deemed herself in safety.</p>

<p>By this time the strong sunshine pierced in a thousand
places the pine-thatch of the forest, fired the red boles,
irradiated the cool aisles of shadow, and burned in jewels
on the grass. The gum of these trees was dearer to the
senses than the gums of Araby; each pine, in the lusty
morning sunlight, burned its own wood-incense; and now
and then a breeze would rise and toss these rooted censers,
and send shade and sun-gem flitting, swift as swallows,
thick as bees; and wake a brushing bustle of sounds that
murmured and went by.</p>

<p>On she passed, and up and down, in sun and shadow;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page179"></a>179</span>
now aloft on the bare ridge among the rocks and birches,
with the lizards and the snakes; and anon in the deep
grove among sunless pillars. Now she followed wandering
wood-paths, in the maze of valleys; and again, from
a hill-top, beheld the distant mountains and the great
birds circling under the sky. She would see afar off a
nestling hamlet, and go round to avoid it. Below, she
traced the course of the foam of mountain torrents. Nearer
hand, she saw where the tender springs welled up in silence,
or oozed in green moss; or in the more favoured hollows
a whole family of infant rivers would combine, and tinkle
in the stones, and lie in pools to be a bathing-place for
sparrows, or fall from the sheer rock in rods of crystal.
Upon all these things, as she still sped along in the bright
air, she looked with a rapture of surprise and a joyful
fainting of the heart; they seemed so novel, they touched
so strangely home, they were so hued and scented, they
were so beset and canopied by the dome of the blue air of
heaven.</p>

<p>At length, when she was well weary, she came upon
a wide and shallow pool. Stones stood in it, like islands;
bulrushes fringed the coast; the floor was paved with
the pine needles; and the pines themselves, whose roots
made promontories, looked down silently on their green
images. She crept to the margin and beheld herself with
wonder, a hollow-and bright-eyed phantom, in the ruins
of her palace robe. The breeze now shook her image; now
it would be marred with flies; and at that she smiled;
and from the fading circles, her counterpart smiled back
to her and looked kind. She sat long in the warm sun, and
pitied her bare arms that were all bruised and marred with
falling, and marvelled to see that she was dirty, and could
not grow to believe that she had gone so long in such a
strange disorder.</p>

<p>Then, with a sigh, she addressed herself to make a toilet
by that forest mirror, washed herself pure from all the
stains of her adventure, took off her jewels and wrapped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180"></a>180</span>
them in her handkerchief, re-arranged the tatters of her
dress, and took down the folds of her hair. She shook
it round her face, and the pool repeated her thus veiled.
Her hair had smelt like violets, she remembered Otto
saying; and so now she tried to smell it, and then shook
her head, and laughed a little, sadly, to herself.</p>

<p>The laugh was returned upon her in a childish echo.
She looked up; and lo! two children looking on,&mdash;a small
girl and a yet smaller boy, standing, like playthings, by
the pool, below a spreading pine. Seraphina was not
fond of children, and now she was startled to the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; she cried hoarsely.</p>

<p>The mites huddled together and drew back; and
Seraphina&rsquo;s heart reproached her that she should have
frightened things so quaint and little, and yet alive with
senses. She thought upon the birds and looked again
at her two visitors; so little larger and so far more innocent.
On their clear faces, as in a pool, she saw the reflection
of their fears. With gracious purpose she arose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do not be afraid of me,&rdquo; and
took a step towards them.</p>

<p>But alas! at the first moment the two poor babes in
the wood turned and ran helter-skelter from the Princess.</p>

<p>The most desolate pang was struck into the girl&rsquo;s heart.
Here she was, twenty-two&mdash;soon twenty-three&mdash;and not a
creature loved her; none but Otto; and would even he
forgive? If she began weeping in these woods alone, it
would mean death or madness. Hastily she trod the
thoughts out like a burning paper; hastily rolled up her
locks, and with terror dogging her, and her whole bosom
sick with grief, resumed her journey.</p>

<p>Past ten in the forenoon, she struck a high-road, marching
in that place uphill between two stately groves, a
river of sunlight; and here, dead weary, careless of consequences,
and taking some courage from the human and
civilised neighbourhood of the road, she stretched herself
on the green margin in the shadow of a tree. Sleep closed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181"></a>181</span>
on her, at first with a horror of fainting, but when she
ceased to struggle, kindly embracing her. So she was
taken home for a little, from all her toils and sorrows, to her
Father&rsquo;s arms. And there in the meanwhile her body lay
exposed by the highwayside, in tattered finery; and on
either hand from the woods the birds came flying by and
calling upon others, and debated in their own tongue this
strange appearance.</p>

<p>The sun pursued his journey; the shadow flitted from
her feet, shrank higher and higher, and was upon the point
of leaving her altogether, when the rumble of a coach was
signalled to and fro by the birds. The road in that part
was very steep; the rumble drew near with great deliberation;
and ten minutes passed before a gentleman appeared,
walking with a sober elderly gait upon the grassy margin of
the highway, and looking pleasantly around him as he
walked. From time to time he paused, took out his note-book
and made an entry with a pencil; and any spy who
had been near enough would have heard him mumbling
words as though he were a poet testing verses. The voice
of the wheels was still faint, and it was plain the traveller
had far outstripped his carriage.</p>

<p>He had drawn very near to where the Princess lay asleep,
before his eye alighted on her; but when it did he started,
pocketed his note-book, and approached. There was a
milestone close to where she lay; and he sat down on that
and coolly studied her. She lay upon one side, all curled
and sunken, her brow on one bare arm, the other stretched
out, limp and dimpled. Her young body, like a thing
thrown down, had scarce a mark of life. Her breathing
stirred her not. The deadliest fatigue was thus confessed
in every language of the sleeping flesh. The traveller
smiled grimly. As though he had looked upon a statue, he
made a grudging inventory of her charms: the figure in
that touching freedom of forgetfulness surprised him; the
flush of slumber became her like a flower.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I did not think the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182"></a>182</span>
girl could be so pretty. And to think,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that
I am under obligation not to use one word of this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put forth his stick and touched her; and at that
she awoke, sat up with a cry, and looked upon him wildly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I trust your Highness has slept well,&rdquo; he said,
nodding.</p>

<p>But she only uttered sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Compose yourself,&rdquo; said he, giving her certainly a
brave example in his own demeanour. &ldquo;My chaise is close
at hand; and I shall have, I trust, the singular entertainment
of abducting a sovereign Princess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John!&rdquo; she said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your Highness&rsquo;s disposal,&rdquo; he replied.</p>

<p>She sprang to her feet. &ldquo;O!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;have you
come from Mittwalden?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This morning,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;I left it; and if there
is anyone less likely to return to it than yourself, behold
him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Baron&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; she began, and paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;it was well meant, and you
are quite a Judith; but after the hours that have elapsed
you will probably be relieved to hear that he is fairly well.
I took his news this morning ere I left. Doing fairly well,
they said, but suffering acutely. Hey?&mdash;acutely. They
could hear his groans in the next room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the Prince,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;is anything known of
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is reported,&rdquo; replied Sir John, with the same
pleasurable deliberation, &ldquo;that upon that point your
Highness is the best authority.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; she said eagerly, &ldquo;you were generous
enough to speak about your carriage. Will you, I beseech
you, will you take me to the Felsenburg? I have business
there of an extreme importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can refuse you nothing,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman,
gravely and seriously enough. &ldquo;Whatever, madam, it is
in my power to do for you, that shall be done with pleasure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"></a>183</span>
As soon as my chaise shall overtake us, it is yours to carry
you where you will. But,&rdquo; added he, reverting to his
former manner, &ldquo;I observe you ask me nothing of the
Palace.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not care,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought I saw it
burning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Prodigious!&rdquo; said the Baronet. &ldquo;You thought?
And can the loss of forty toilettes leave you cold? Well,
madam, I admire your fortitude. And the state, too?
As I left, the government was sitting,&mdash;the new government,
of which at least two members must be known to you by
name: Sabra, who had, I believe, the benefit of being
formed in your employment&mdash;a footman,&mdash;am I right?&mdash;and
our old friend the Chancellor, in something of a
subaltern position. But in these convulsions the last shall
be first, and the first last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; she said, with an air of perfect honesty,
&ldquo;I am sure you mean most kindly, but these matters
have no interest for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Baronet was so utterly discountenanced that he
hailed the appearance of his chaise with welcome, and,
by way of saying something, proposed that they should
walk back to meet it. So it was done; and he helped her
in with courtesy, mounted to her side, and from various
receptacles (for the chaise was most completely fitted out)
produced fruits and truffled liver, beautiful white bread,
and a bottle of delicate wine. With these he served her
like a father, coaxing and praising her to fresh exertions;
and during all that time, as though silenced by the laws of
hospitality, he was not guilty of the shadow of a sneer.
Indeed, his kindness seemed so genuine that Seraphina
was moved to gratitude.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you hate me in your heart;
why are you so kind to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, my good lady,&rdquo; said he with no disclaimer of the
accusation, &ldquo;I have the honour to be much your husband&rsquo;s
friend, and somewhat his admirer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184"></a>184</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They told me you wrote cruelly
of both of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such was the strange path by which we grew acquainted,&rdquo;
said Sir John. &ldquo;I had written, madam, with
particular cruelty (since that shall be the phrase) of your
fair self. Your husband set me at liberty, gave me a passport,
ordered a carriage, and then, with the most boyish
spirit, challenged me to fight. Knowing the nature of his
married life, I thought the dash and loyalty he showed
delightful. &lsquo;Do not be afraid,&rsquo; says he: &lsquo;if I am killed
there is nobody to miss me.&rsquo; It appears you subsequently
thought of that yourself. But I digress. I explained to
him it was impossible that I could fight! &lsquo;Not if I strike
you?&rsquo; says he. Very droll; I wish I could have put it in
my book. However, I was conquered, took the young
gentleman to my high favour, and tore up my bits of
scandal on the spot. That is one of the little favours,
madam, that you owe your husband.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seraphina sat for some while in silence. She could
bear to be misjudged without a pang by those whom
she contemned; she had none of Otto&rsquo;s eagerness to
be approved, but went her own way straight and head
in air. To Sir John, however, after what he had said,
and as her husband&rsquo;s friend, she was prepared to
stoop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you think of me?&rdquo; she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you already,&rdquo; said Sir John: &ldquo;I think
you want another glass of my good wine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;this is unlike you. You are not
wont to be afraid. You say that you admire my husband:
in his name, be honest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I admire your courage,&rdquo; said the Baronet. &ldquo;Beyond
that, as you have guessed, and indeed said, our natures
are not sympathetic.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You spoke of scandal,&rdquo; pursued Seraphina. &ldquo;Was
the scandal great?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was considerable,&rdquo; said Sir John.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page185"></a>185</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And you believed it?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, madam,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;the question!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you for that answer!&rdquo; cried Seraphina. &ldquo;And
now here, I will tell you, upon my honour, upon my soul,
in spite of all the scandal in this world, I am as true a wife
as ever stood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We should probably not agree upon a definition,&rdquo;
observed Sir John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I have abominably used him&mdash;I
know that; it is not that I mean. But if you admire my
husband, I insist that you shall understand me: I can
look him in the face without a blush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be, madam,&rdquo; said Sir John; &ldquo;or have I presumed
to think the contrary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will not believe me?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You think
I am a guilty wife? You think he was my lover?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; returned the Baronet, &ldquo;when I tore up my
papers I promised your good husband to concern myself
no more with your affairs; and I assure you for the last
time that I have no desire to judge you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you will not acquit me! Ah!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;<i>he</i>
will&mdash;he knows me better!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Sir John smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You smile at my distress?&rdquo; asked Seraphina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;At your woman&rsquo;s coolness,&rdquo; said Sir John. &ldquo;A man
would scarce have had the courage of that cry, which was,
for all that, very natural, and I make no doubt quite true.
But remark, madam&mdash;since you do me the honour to
consult me gravely&mdash;I have no pity for what you call your
distresses. You have been completely selfish, and now
reap the consequence. Had you once thought of your
husband, instead of singly thinking of yourself, you would
not now have been alone, a fugitive, with blood upon your
hands, and hearing from a morose old Englishman truth
more bitter than scandal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; she said, quivering. &ldquo;This is very true.
Will you stop the carriage?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186"></a>186</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No, child,&rdquo; said Sir John, &ldquo;not until I see you mistress
of yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which the carriage rolled
by rock and woodland.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she resumed, with perfect steadiness,
&ldquo;will you consider me composed? I request you, as a
gentleman, to let me out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you do unwisely,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Continue,
if you please, to use my carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir John,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;if death were sitting on that
pile of stones, I would alight! I do not blame, I thank
you; I now know how I appear to others; but sooner
than draw breath beside a man who can so think of me,
I would&mdash;&mdash; O!&rdquo; she cried, and was silent.</p>

<p>Sir John pulled the string, alighted, and offered her
his hand, but she refused the help.</p>

<p>The road had now issued from the valleys in which
it had been winding, and come to that part of its course
where it runs, like a cornice, along the brow of the steep
northward face of Gr√ºnewald. The place where they had
alighted was at a salient angle; a bold rock and some
wind-tortured pine-trees overhung it from above; far
below the blue plains lay forth and melted into heaven;
and before them the road, by a succession of bold zigzags,
was seen mounting to where a tower upon a tall cliff closed
the view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; said the Baronet, pointing to the tower,
&ldquo;you see the Felsenburg, your goal. I wish you a good
journey, and regret I cannot be of more assistance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He mounted to his place and gave a signal, and the
carriage rolled away.</p>

<p>Seraphina stood by the wayside, gazing before her with
blind eyes. Sir John she had dismissed already from her
mind; she hated him, that was enough; for whatever
Seraphina hated or contemned fell instantly to Lilliputian
smallness, and was thenceforward steadily ignored in
thought. And now she had matter for concern indeed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187"></a>187</span>
Her interview with Otto, which she had never yet forgiven
him, began to appear before her in a very different light.
He had come to her, still thrilling under recent insult, and
not yet breathed from fighting her own cause; and how
that knowledge changed the value of his words! Yes,
he must have loved her; this was a brave feeling&mdash;it was
no mere weakness of the will. And she, was she incapable
of love? It would appear so; and she swallowed her
tears, and yearned to see Otto, to explain all, to ask pity
upon her knees for her transgressions, and, if all else were
now beyond the reach of reparation, to restore at least the
liberty of which she had deprived him.</p>

<p>Swiftly she sped along the highway, and, as the road
wound out and in about the bluffs and gullies of the
mountain, saw and lost by glimpses the tall tower that
stood before and above her, purpled by the mountain air.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>TREATS OF A CHRISTIAN VIRTUE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">When</span> Otto mounted to his rolling prison he found
another occupant in a corner of the front seat; but as
this person hung his head and the brightness of the
carriage-lamps shone outward, the Prince could only see
it was a man. The Colonel followed his prisoner and
clapped-to the door; and at that the four horses broke
immediately into a swinging trot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Colonel, after some little while
had passed, &ldquo;if we are to travel in silence, we might as
well be at home. I appear, of course, in an invidious
character; but I am a man of taste, fond of books and
solidly informing talk, and unfortunately condemned for
life to the guard-room. Gentlemen, this is my chance:
don&rsquo;t spoil it for me. I have here the pick of the whole
court, barring lovely woman; I have a great author in the
person of the Doctor&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gotthold!&rdquo; cried Otto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; said the Doctor bitterly, &ldquo;that we must
go together. Your Highness had not calculated upon
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you infer?&rdquo; cried Otto; &ldquo;that I had you
arrested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The inference is simple,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Gordon,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;oblige me so far,
and set me right with Herr von Hohenstockwitz.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;you are both arrested
on the same warrant in the name of the Princess Seraphina,
acting regent, countersigned by Prime Minister Freiherr
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189"></a>189</span>
von Gondremark, and dated the day before yesterday, the
twelfth. I reveal to you the secrets of the prison-house,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; said Gotthold, &ldquo;I ask you to pardon my
suspicions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gotthold,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I am not certain I can
grant you that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is, I am sure, far too magnanimous
to hesitate,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;But allow me: we speak
at home in my religion of the means of grace: and I now
propose to offer them.&rdquo; So saying, the Colonel lighted a
bright lamp which he attached to one side of the carriage,
and from below the front seat produced a goodly basket
adorned with the long necks of bottles. &ldquo;<i>Tu spem reducis</i>&mdash;how
does it go, Doctor?&rdquo; he asked gaily. &ldquo;I am, in a
sense, your host; and I am sure you are both far too
considerate of my embarrassing position to refuse to do
me honour. Gentlemen, I drink to the Prince!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;we have a jovial entertainer.
I drink to Colonel Gordon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thereupon all three took their wine very pleasantly;
and even as they did so, the carriage with a lurch
turned into the high-road and began to make better
speed.</p>

<p>All was bright within; the wine had coloured Gotthold&rsquo;s
cheek; dim forms of forest trees, dwindling and spiring,
scarves of the starry sky, now wide and now narrow,
raced past the windows; through one that was left open
the air of the woods came in with a nocturnal raciness;
and the roll of wheels and the tune of the trotting horses
sounded merrily on the ear. Toast followed toast; glass
after glass was bowed across and emptied by the trio;
and presently there began to fall upon them a luxurious
spell, under the influence of which little but the sound of
quiet and confidential laughter interrupted the long intervals
of meditative silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; said Gotthold, after one of these seasons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190"></a>190</span>
quiet, &ldquo;I do not ask you to forgive me. Were the parts
reversed, I could not forgive you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Otto, &ldquo;it is a phrase we use. I do forgive
you, but your words and your suspicions rankle; and not
yours alone. It is idle, Colonel Gordon, in view of the
order you are carrying out, to conceal from you the dissensions
of my family; they have gone so far that they are
now public property. Well, gentlemen, can I forgive my
wife? I can, of course, and do; but in what sense?
I would certainly not stoop to any revenge; as certainly
I could not think of her but as one changed beyond my
recognition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Allow me,&rdquo; returned the Colonel. &ldquo;You will permit me
to hope that I am addressing Christians? We are all
conscious, I trust, that we are miserable sinners.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I disown the consciousness,&rdquo; said Gotthold. &ldquo;Warmed
with this good fluid, I deny your thesis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How, sir? You never did anything wrong? and I
heard you asking pardon but this moment, not of your
God, sir, but of a common fellow-worm!&rdquo; the Colonel
cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I own you have me; you are expert in argument,
Herr Oberst,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Begad, sir, I am proud to hear you say so,&rdquo; said the
Colonel. &ldquo;I was well grounded indeed at Aberdeen. And
as for this matter of forgiveness, it comes, sir, of loose
views and (what is if anything more dangerous) a regular
life. A sound creed and a bad morality, that&rsquo;s the root
of wisdom. You two gentlemen are too good to be forgiving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The paradox is somewhat forced,&rdquo; said Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Colonel,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;I readily
acquit you of any design of offence, but your words bite
like satire. Is this a time, do you think, when I can wish
to hear myself called good, now that I am paying the
penalty (and am willing like yourself to think it just) of
my prolonged misconduct?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page191"></a>191</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, pardon me!&rdquo; cried the Colonel. &ldquo;You have
never been expelled from the divinity hall; you have never
been broke. I was: broke for a neglect of military duty.
To tell you the open truth, your Highness, I was the worse
of drink; it&rsquo;s a thing I never do now,&rdquo; he added, taking
out his glass. &ldquo;But a man, you see, who has really tasted
the defects of his own character, as I have, and has come
to regard himself as a kind of blind teetotum knocking
about life, begins to learn a very different view about
forgiveness. I will talk of not forgiving others, sir, when
I have made out to forgive myself, and not before; and
the date is like to be a long one. My father, the Reverend
Alexander Gordon, was a good man, and damned hard
upon others. I am what they call a bad one, and that is
just the difference. The man who cannot forgive any
mortal thing is a green hand in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet I have heard of you, Colonel, as a duellist,&rdquo;
said Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A different thing, sir,&rdquo; replied the soldier. &ldquo;Professional
etiquette. And I trust without unchristian
feeling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Presently after the Colonel fell into a deep sleep; and
his companions looked upon each other, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An odd fish,&rdquo; said Gotthold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And a strange guardian,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;Yet
what he said was true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rightly looked upon,&rdquo; mused Gotthold, &ldquo;it is ourselves
that we cannot forgive, when we refuse forgiveness
to our friend. Some strand of our own misdoing is involved
in every quarrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are there not offences that disgrace the pardoner?&rdquo;
asked Otto. &ldquo;Are there not bounds of self-respect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; said Gotthold, &ldquo;does any man respect himself?
To this poor waif of a soldier of fortune we may
seem respectable gentlemen; but to ourselves, what are
we unless a pasteboard portico and a deliquium of deadly
weaknesses within?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page192"></a>192</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I? yes,&rdquo; said Otto; &ldquo;but you, Gotthold&mdash;you, with
your interminable industry, your keen mind, your books&mdash;serving
mankind, scorning pleasures and temptations!
You do not know how I envy you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;in one word, and a bitter one
to say: I am a secret tippler. Yes, I drink too much.
The habit has robbed these very books, to which you
praise my devotion, of the merits that they should have
had. It has spoiled my temper. When I spoke to you
the other day, how much of my warmth was in the cause
of virtue? how much was the fever of last night&rsquo;s wine?
Ay, as my poor fellow-sot there said, and as I vaingloriously
denied, we are all miserable sinners, put here for a moment,
knowing the good, choosing the evil, standing naked and
ashamed in the eye of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it so?&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;Why, then, what are we?
Are the very best&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no best in man,&rdquo; said Gotthold. &ldquo;I am
not better, it is likely I am not worse, than you or that
poor sleeper. I was a sham, and now you know me:
that is all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And yet it has not changed my love,&rdquo; returned Otto
softly. &ldquo;Our misdeeds do not change us. Gotthold,
fill your glass. Let us drink to what is good in this bad
business; let us drink to our old affection; and, when we
have done so, forgive your too just grounds of offence,
and drink with me to my wife, whom I have so misused,
who has so misused me, and whom I have left, I fear, I
greatly fear, in danger. What matters it how bad we are,
if others can still love us, and we can still love others?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay!&rdquo; replied the Doctor. &ldquo;It is very well said.
It is the true answer to the pessimist, and the standing
miracle of mankind. So you still love me? and so you
can forgive your wife? Why, then, we may bid conscience
&rsquo;Down, dog,&rsquo; like an ill-trained puppy yapping at shadows.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The pair fell into silence, the Doctor tapping on his
empty glass.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page193"></a>193</span></p>

<p>The carriage swung forth out of the valleys on that
open balcony of high-road that runs along the front of
Gr√ºnewald, looking down on Gerolstein. Far below, a
white waterfall was shining to the stars from the falling
skirts of forest, and beyond that, the night stood naked
above the plain. On the other hand, the lamplight skimmed
the face of the precipices, and the dwarf pine-trees twinkled
with all their needles, and were gone again into the wake.
The granite roadway thundered under wheels and hoofs;
and at times, by reason of its continual winding, Otto
could see the escort on the other side of a ravine, riding
well together in the night. Presently the Felsenburg
came plainly in view, some way above them, on a bold
projection of the mountain, and planting its bulk against
the starry sky.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See, Gotthold,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;our destination.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gotthold awoke as from a trance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was thinking,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if there is any danger,
why did you not resist? I was told you came of your
free will; but should you not be there to help her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour faded from the Prince&rsquo;s cheeks.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>PROVIDENCE VON ROSEN: ACT THE LAST
IN WHICH SHE GALLOPS OFF</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">When</span> the busy Countess came forth from her interview
with Seraphina, it is not too much to say that she was
beginning to be terribly afraid. She paused in the corridor
and reckoned up her doings with an eye to Gondremark.
The fan was in requisition in an instant; but her disquiet
was beyond the reach of fanning. &ldquo;The girl has lost her
head,&rdquo; she thought; and then dismally, &ldquo;I have gone too
far.&rdquo; She instantly decided on secession. Now the <i>Mons
Sacer</i> of the Frau von Rosen was a certain rustic villa in
the forest, called by herself, in a smart attack of poesy,
Tannen Zauber, and by everybody else plain Kleinbrunn.</p>

<p>Thither, upon the thought, she furiously drove, passing
Gondremark at the entrance to the palace avenue, but
feigning not to observe him; and as Kleinbrunn was
seven good miles away, and in the bottom of a narrow
dell, she passed the night without any rumour of the
outbreak reaching her; and the glow of the conflagration
was concealed by intervening hills. Frau von Rosen did
not sleep well; she was seriously uneasy as to the results
of her delightful evening, and saw herself condemned to
quite a lengthy sojourn in her deserts and a long defensive
correspondence, ere she could venture to return to Gondremark.
On the other hand, she examined, by way of
pastime, the deeds she had received from Otto; and
even here saw cause for disappointment. In these troublous
days she had no taste for landed property, and she was
convinced, besides, that Otto had paid dearer than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page195"></a>195</span>
farm was worth. Lastly, the order for the Prince&rsquo;s release
fairly burned her meddling fingers.</p>

<p>All things considered, the next day beheld an elegant
and beautiful lady, in a riding-habit and a flapping hat,
draw bridle at the gate of the Felsenburg, not perhaps
with any clear idea of her purpose, but with her usual
experimental views on life. Governor Gordon, summoned
to the gate, welcomed the omnipotent Countess with his
most gallant bearing, though it was wonderful how old
he looked in the morning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, Governor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we have surprises for you,
sir,&rdquo; and nodded at him meaningly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh, madam, leave me my prisoners,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and
if you will but join the band, begad, I&rsquo;ll be happy for life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would spoil me, would you not?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would try, I would try,&rdquo; returned the Governor,
and he offered her his arm.</p>

<p>She took it, picked up her skirt, and drew him close to
her. &ldquo;I have come to see the Prince,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Now,
infidel! on business. A message from that stupid Gondremark,
who keeps me running like a courier. Do I look
like one, Herr Gordon?&rdquo; And she planted her eyes in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You look like an angel, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; returned the Governor,
with a great air of finished gallantry.</p>

<p>The Countess laughed. &ldquo;An angel on horseback!&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;Quick work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You came, you saw, you conquered,&rdquo; flourished
Gordon, in high good humour with his own wit and grace.
&ldquo;We toasted you, madam, in the carriage, in an excellent
good glass of wine; toasted you fathom deep; the finest
woman, with, begad, the finest eyes in Gr√ºnewald. I
never saw the like of them but once, in my own country,
when I was a young fool at College: Thomasina Haig her
name was. I give you my word of honour, she was as
like you as two peas.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so you were merry in the carriage?&rdquo; asked the
Countess, gracefully dissembling a yawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page196"></a>196</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We were; we had a very pleasant conversation;
but we took perhaps a glass more than that fine fellow
of a Prince has been accustomed to,&rdquo; said the Governor;
&ldquo;and I observe this morning that he seems a little off his
mettle. We&rsquo;ll get him mellow again ere bedtime. This
is his door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;let me get my breath. No,
no; wait. Have the door ready to open.&rdquo; And the
Countess, standing like one inspired, shook out her fine
voice in &ldquo;Lascia ch&rsquo;io pianga&ldquo;; and when she had reached
the proper point, and lyrically uttered forth her sighings
after liberty, the door, at a sign, was flung wide open, and
she swam into the Prince&rsquo;s sight, bright-eyed, and with her
colour somewhat freshened by the exercise of singing. It
was a great dramatic entrance, and to the somewhat
doleful prisoner within the sight was sunshine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, madam,&rdquo; he cried, running to her&mdash;&ldquo;you here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked meaningly at Gordon; and as soon as the
door was closed she fell on Otto&rsquo;s neck. &ldquo;To see you
here!&rdquo; she moaned and clung to him.</p>

<p>But the Prince stood somewhat stiffly in that enviable
situation, and the Countess instantly recovered from her
outburst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;poor child! Sit down beside
me here, and tell me all about it. My heart really bleeds
to see you. How does time go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied the Prince, sitting down beside
her, his gallantry recovered, &ldquo;the time will now go all
too quickly till you leave. But I must ask you for the
news. I have most bitterly condemned myself for my
inertia of last night. You wisely counselled me: it was
my duty to resist. You wisely and nobly counselled me;
I have since thought of it with wonder. You have a noble
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;spare me. Was it even right, I
wonder? I have duties, too, you poor child; and when
I see you they all melt&mdash;all my good resolutions fly away.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"></a>197</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And mine still come too late,&rdquo; he replied, sighing.
&ldquo;O, what would I not give to have resisted? What
would I not give for freedom?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what would you give?&rdquo; she asked; and the
red fan was spread; only her eyes, as if from over battlements,
brightly surveyed him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I? What do you mean? Madam, you have some
news for me,&rdquo; he cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, O!&rdquo; said madam dubiously.</p>

<p>He was at her feet. &ldquo;Do not trifle with my hopes,&rdquo;
he pleaded. &ldquo;Tell me, dearest Madame von Rosen, tell
me! You cannot be cruel: it is not in your nature.
Give? I can give nothing; I have nothing; I can only
plead in mercy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is not fair. Otto, you know
my weakness. Spare me. Be generous.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is for you to be generous,
to have pity.&rdquo; He took her hand and pressed it; he
plied her with caresses and appeals. The Countess had
a most enjoyable sham siege, and then relented. She
sprang to her feet, she tore her dress open, and, all warm
from her bosom, threw the order on the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I forced it from her. Use it,
and I am ruined!&rdquo; And she turned away as if to veil
the force of her emotions.</p>

<p>Otto sprang upon the paper, read it, and cried out
aloud. &ldquo;O, God bless her!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;God bless her.&rdquo;
And he kissed the writing.</p>

<p>Von Rosen was a singularly good-natured woman,
but her part was now beyond her. &ldquo;Ingrate!&rdquo; she
cried; &ldquo;I wrung it from her, I betrayed my trust to get
it, and &rsquo;tis she you thank!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can you blame me?&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;I love her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see that,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And I?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Madame von Rosen? You are my dearest, my
kindest, and most generous of friends,&rdquo; he said, approaching
her. &ldquo;You would be a perfect friend, if you were not so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"></a>198</span>
lovely. You have a great sense of humour, you cannot
be unconscious of your charm, and you amuse yourself at
times by playing on my weakness; and at times I can
take pleasure in the comedy. But not to-day: to-day you
will be the true, the serious, the manly friend, and you will
suffer me to forget that you are lovely and that I am
weak. Come, dear Countess, let me to-day repose in you
entirely.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out his hand, smiling, and she took it frankly.
&ldquo;I vow you have bewitched me,&rdquo; she said; and then
with a laugh, &ldquo;I break my staff&ldquo;! she added; &ldquo;and I
must pay you my best compliment. You made a difficult
speech. You are as adroit, dear Prince, as I am&mdash;charming.&rdquo;
And as she said the word with a great curtsey, she
justified it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hardly keep the bargain, madam, when you make
yourself so beautiful,&rdquo; said the Prince, bowing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was my last arrow,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;I am disarmed.
Blank cartridge, <i>O mon Prince!</i> And now I
tell you, if you choose to leave this prison, you can, and
I am ruined. Choose!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Madame von Rosen,&rdquo; replied Otto, &ldquo;I choose, and I
will go. My duty points me, duty still neglected by this
Featherhead. But do not fear to be a loser. I propose
instead that you should take me with you, a bear in chains,
to Baron Gondremark. I am become perfectly unscrupulous:
to save my wife I will do all, all he can ask
or fancy. He shall be filled; were he huge as leviathan
and greedy as the grave, I will content him. And you,
the fairy of our pantomime, shall have the credit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Admirable! Prince Charming
no longer&mdash;Prince Sorcerer, Prince Solon! Let us go this
moment. Stay,&rdquo; she cried, pausing. &ldquo;I beg, dear Prince,
to give you back these deeds. &rsquo;Twas you who liked the
farm&mdash;I have not seen it; and it was you who wished to
benefit the peasants. And, besides,&rdquo; she added, with a
comical change of tone, &ldquo;I should prefer the ready money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"></a>199</span></p>

<p>Both laughed. &ldquo;Here I am, once more a farmer,&rdquo; said
Otto, accepting the papers, &ldquo;but overwhelmed in debt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Countess touched a bell, and the Governor appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Governor,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am going to elope with his
Highness. The result of our talk has been a thorough
understanding, and the <i>coup d&rsquo;√©tat</i> is over. Here is the
order.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Colonel Gordon adjusted silver spectacles upon his nose.
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Princess: very right. But the
warrant, madam, was countersigned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Heinrich!&rdquo; said von Rosen. &ldquo;Well, and here am
I to represent him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, your Highness,&rdquo; resumed the soldier of fortune,
&ldquo;I must congratulate you upon my loss. You have been
cut out by beauty, and I am left lamenting. The Doctor
still remains to me: <i>probus</i>, <i>doctus</i>, <i>lepidus</i>, <i>jucundus</i>: a
man of books.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, there is nothing about poor Gotthold,&rdquo; said the
Prince.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Governor&rsquo;s consolation? Would you leave him
bare?&rdquo; asked von Rosen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, your Highness,&rdquo; resumed Gordon, &ldquo;may I trust
that in the course of this temporary obscuration, you
have found me discharge my part with suitable respect and,
I may add, tact? I adopted purposely a cheerfulness of
manner; mirth, it appeared to me, and a good glass of
wine, were the fit alleviations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel,&rdquo; said Otto, holding out his hand, &ldquo;your
society was of itself enough. I do not merely thank you
for your pleasant spirits; I have to thank you, besides,
for some philosophy, of which I stood in need. I trust I
do not see you for the last time; and in the meanwhile,
as a memento of our strange acquaintance, let me offer you
these verses on which I was but now engaged. I am so
little of a poet, and was so ill inspired by prison bars, that
they have some claim to be at least a curiosity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Colonel&rsquo;s countenance lighted as he took the paper;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"></a>200</span>
the silver spectacles were hurriedly replaced. &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;Alexandrines, the tragic metre. I shall cherish
this, your Highness, like a relic; no more suitable offering,
although I say it, could be made. &lsquo;<i>Dieux de l&rsquo;immense
plaine et des vastes for√™ts.</i>&rsquo; Very good,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;very
good indeed! &lsquo;<i>Et du ge√¥lier lui-m√™me apprendre des
le√ßons.</i>&rsquo; Most handsome, begad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, Governor,&rdquo; cried the Countess, &ldquo;you can
read his poetry when we are gone. Open your grudging
portals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ask your pardon,&rdquo; said the Colonel. &ldquo;To a man
of my character and tastes, these verses, this handsome
reference&mdash;most moving, I assure you. Can I offer you
an escort?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; replied the Countess. &ldquo;We go incogniti,
as we arrived. We ride together; the Prince will take
my servant&rsquo;s horse. Hurry and privacy, Herr Oberst,
that is all we seek.&rdquo; And she began impatiently to lead
the way.</p>

<p>But Otto had still to bid farewell to Dr. Gotthold; and,
the Governor following, with his spectacles in one hand
and the paper in the other, had still to communicate his
treasured verses, piece by piece, as he succeeded in deciphering
the manuscript, to all he came across; and still his
enthusiasm mounted. &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo; he cried at last, with
the air of one who has at length divined a mystery, &ldquo;they
remind me of Robbie Burns!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there is an end to all things; and at length Otto
was walking by the side of Madame von Rosen, along
that mountain wall, her servant following with both the
horses, and all about them sunlight, and breeze, and flying
bird, and the vast regions of the air, and the capacious
prospect: wildwood and climbing pinnacle, and the sound
and voice of mountain torrents, at their hand; and far
below them, green melting into sapphire on the plains.</p>

<p>They walked at first in silence; for Otto&rsquo;s mind was
full of the delight of liberty and nature, and still, betweenwhiles,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201"></a>201</span>
he was preparing his interview with Gondremark.
But when the first rough promontory of the rock was
turned, and the Felsenburg concealed behind its bulk, the
lady paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I will dismount poor Karl, and you
and I must ply our spurs. I love a wild ride with a good
companion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she spoke, a carriage came into sight round the corner
next below them in the order of the road. It came heavily
creaking, and a little ahead of it a traveller was soberly
walking, note-book in hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is Sir John,&rdquo; cried Otto, and he hailed him.</p>

<p>The Baronet pocketed his note-book, stared through an
eye-glass, and then waved his stick; and he on his side,
and the Countess and the Prince on theirs, advanced
with somewhat quicker steps. They met at the re-entrant
angle, where a thin stream sprayed across a boulder and
was scattered in rain among the brush; and the Baronet
saluted the Prince with much punctilio. To the Countess,
on the other hand, he bowed with a kind of sneering wonder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it possible, madam, that you have not heard the
news?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What news?&rdquo; she cried.</p>

<p>&ldquo;News of the first order,&rdquo; returned Sir John: &ldquo;a
revolution in the state, a Republic declared, the palace
burned to the ground, the Princess in flight, Gondremark
wounded&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heinrich wounded?&rdquo; she screamed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wounded and suffering acutely,&rdquo; said Sir John.
&ldquo;His groans&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There fell from the lady&rsquo;s lips an oath so potent that,
in smoother hours, it would have made her hearers jump.
She ran to her horse, scrambled to the saddle, and, yet
half-seated, dashed down the road at full gallop. The
groom, after a pause of wonder, followed her. The rush
of her impetuous passage almost scared the carriage-horses
over the verge of the steep hill; and still she clattered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"></a>202</span>
further and the crags echoed to her flight, and still the
groom flogged vainly in pursuit of her. At the fourth
corner, a woman trailing slowly up leaped back with a
cry and escaped death by a hand&rsquo;s-breadth. But the
Countess wasted neither glance nor thought upon the
incident. Out and in, about the bluffs of the mountain
wall, she fled, loose-reined, and still the groom toiled in
her pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A most impulsive lady!&rdquo; said Sir John. &ldquo;Who
would have thought she cared for him?&rdquo; And before the
words were uttered, he was struggling in the Prince&rsquo;s
grasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My wife! the Princess? What of her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is down the road,&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;I left her
twenty minutes back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And next moment the choked author stood alone, and
the Prince on foot was racing down the hill behind the
Countess.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>BABES IN THE WOOD</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">While</span> the feet of the Prince continued to run swiftly, his
heart, which had at first by far outstripped his running,
soon began to linger and hang back. Not that he ceased to
pity the misfortune or to yearn for the sight of Seraphina;
but the memory of her obdurate coldness awoke within him,
and woke in turn his own habitual diffidence of self. Had
Sir John been given time to tell him all, had he even known
that she was speeding to the Felsenburg, he would have
gone to her with ardour. As it was, he began to see himself
once more intruding, profiting, perhaps, by her misfortune,
and now that she was fallen, proffering unloved
caresses to the wife who had spurned him in prosperity.
The sore spots upon his vanity began to burn; once more,
his anger assumed the carriage of a hostile generosity;
he would utterly forgive indeed; he would help, save, and
comfort his unloving wife; but all with distant self-denial,
imposing silence on his heart, respecting Seraphina&rsquo;s disaffection
as he would the innocence of a child. So, when
at length he turned a corner and beheld the Princess, it
was his first thought to reassure her of the purity of his
respect, and he at once ceased running and stood still.
She, upon her part, began to run to him with a little cry;
then, seeing him pause, she paused also, smitten with
remorse, and at length, with the most guilty timidity,
walked nearly up to where he stood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have ruined all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seraphina!&rdquo; he cried with a sob, but did not move,
partly withheld by his resolutions, partly struck stupid at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"></a>204</span>
the sight of her weariness and disorder. Had she stood
silent, they had soon been locked in an embrace. But she
too had prepared herself against the interview, and must
spoil the golden hour with protestations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All!&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I have ruined all! But, Otto,
in kindness you must hear me&mdash;not justify, but own, my
faults. I have been taught so cruelly; I have had such
time for thought, and see the world so changed. I have
been blind, stone-blind; I have let all true good go by me,
and lived on shadows. But when this dream fell, and I
had betrayed you, and thought I had killed&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She
paused. &ldquo;I thought I had killed Gondremark,&rdquo; she said
with a deep flush, &ldquo;and I found myself alone, as you
said.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The mention of the name of Gondremark pricked the
Prince&rsquo;s generosity like a spur. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;and
whose fault was it but mine? It was my duty to be beside
you, loved or not. But I was a skulker in the grain, and
found it easier to desert than to oppose you. I could
never learn that better part of love, to fight love&rsquo;s battles.
But yet the love was there. And now when this toy
kingdom of ours has fallen, first of all by my demerits, and
next by your inexperience, and we are here alone together,
as poor as Job and merely a man and a woman&mdash;let me
conjure you to forgive the weakness and to repose in the
love. Do not mistake me!&rdquo; he cried, seeing her about to
speak, and imposing silence with uplifted hand. &ldquo;My
love is changed; it is purged of any conjugal pretension;
it does not ask, does not hope, does not wish for a return in
kind. You may forget for ever that part in which you
found me so distasteful, and accept without embarrassment
the affection of a brother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are too generous, Otto,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know that
I have forfeited your love. I cannot take this sacrifice.
You had far better leave me. O go away, and leave me
to my fate!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O no!&rdquo; said Otto; &ldquo;we must first of all escape out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"></a>205</span>
of this hornets&rsquo; nest, to which I led you. My honour
is engaged. I said but now we were as poor as Job; and
behold! not many miles from here I have a house of my
own to which I will conduct you. Otto the Prince being
down, we must try what luck remains to Otto the Hunter.
Come, Seraphina; show that you forgive me, and let us
set about this business of escape in the best spirits possible.
You used to say, my dear, that, except as a husband and a
prince, I was a pleasant fellow. I am neither now, and
you may like my company without remorse. Come,
then; it were idle to be captured. Can you still walk?
Forth, then,&rdquo; said he, and he began to lead the way.</p>

<p>A little below where they stood, a good-sized brook
passed below the road, which overleapt it in a single arch.
On one bank of that loquacious water a footpath descended
a green dell. Here it was rocky and stony, and lay on the
steep scarps of the ravine; here it was choked with
brambles; and there, in fairy haughs, it lay for a few
paces evenly on the green turf. Like a sponge, the hillside
oozed with well-water. The burn kept growing both in
force and volume; at every leap it fell with heavier plunges
and span more widely in the pool. Great had been the
labours of that stream, and great and agreeable the changes
it had wrought. It had cut through dykes of stubborn
rock, and now, like a blowing dolphin, spouted through
the orifice; along all its humble coasts, it had undermined
and rafted-down the goodlier timber of the forest;
and on these rough clearings it now set and tended primrose
gardens, and planted woods of willow, and made a favourite
of the silver birch. Through all these friendly features
the path, its human acolyte, conducted our two wanderers
downward&mdash;Otto before, still pausing at the more difficult
passages to lend assistance; the Princess following. From
time to time, when he turned to help her, her face would
lighten upon his&mdash;her eyes, half desperately, woo him. He
saw, but dare not understand. &ldquo;She does not love me,&rdquo;
he told himself, with magnanimity. &ldquo;This is remorse
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"></a>206</span>
or gratitude; I were no gentleman, no, nor yet a man,
if I presumed upon these pitiful concessions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Some way down the glen, the stream, already grown
to a good bulk of water, was rudely dammed across, and
about a third of it abducted in a wooden trough. Gaily
the pure water, air&rsquo;s first cousin, fleeted along the rude
aqueduct, whose sides and floor it had made green with
grasses. The path, bearing it close company, threaded
a wilderness of briar and wild-rose. And presently, a
little in front, the brown top of a mill and the tall mill-wheel,
spraying diamonds, arose in the narrows of the
glen; at the same time the snoring music of the saws
broke the silence.</p>

<p>The miller, hearing steps, came forth to his door, and
both he and Otto started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good morning, miller,&rdquo; said the Prince. &ldquo;You were
right, it seems, and I was wrong. I give you the news,
and bid you to Mittwalden. My throne has fallen&mdash;great
was the fall of it!&mdash;and your good friends of the Ph&oelig;nix
bear the rule.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The red-faced miller looked supreme astonishment.
&ldquo;And your Highness?&rdquo; he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My Highness is running away,&rdquo; replied Otto, &ldquo;straight
for the frontier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving Gr√ºnewald?&rdquo; cried the man. &ldquo;Your
father&rsquo;s son? It&rsquo;s not to be permitted!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you arrest us, friend?&rdquo; asked Otto, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Arrest you? I?&rdquo; exclaimed the man. &ldquo;For what
does your Highness take me? Why, sir, I make sure
there is not a man in Gr√ºnewald would lay hands upon
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, many, many,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;but from you,
who were bold with me in my greatness, I should even
look for aid in my distress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The miller became the colour of beetroot. &ldquo;You may
say so indeed,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;And meanwhile, will you and
your lady step into my house?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"></a>207</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;We have not time for that,&rdquo; replied the Prince; &ldquo;but
if you would oblige us with a cup of wine without here,
you will give a pleasure and a service, both in one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The miller once more coloured to the nape. He hastened
to bring forth wine in a pitcher and three bright crystal
tumblers. &ldquo;Your Highness must not suppose,&rdquo; he said,
as he filled them, &ldquo;that I am an habitual drinker. The
time when I had the misfortune to encounter you, I was
a trifle overtaken, I allow; but a more sober man than
I am in my ordinary, I do not know where you are to look
for; and even this glass that I drink to you (and to the
lady) is quite an unusual recreation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The wine was drunk with due rustic courtesies; and
then, refusing further hospitality, Otto and Seraphina once
more proceeded to descend the glen, which now began to
open and to be invaded by the taller trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I owed that man a reparation,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;for
when we met I was in the wrong and put a sore affront
upon him. I judge by myself, perhaps; but I begin to
think that no one is the better for a humiliation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But some have to be taught so,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; he said, with a painful embarrassment.
&ldquo;Well, well. But let us think of safety. My miller is all
very good, but I do not pin my faith to him. To follow
down this stream will bring us, but after innumerable
windings, to my house. Here, up this glade, there lies
a cross-cut&mdash;the world&rsquo;s end for solitude&mdash;the very deer
scarce visit it. Are you too tired, or could you pass that
way?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Choose the path, Otto. I will follow you,&rdquo; she said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, with a singular imbecility of manner
and appearance, &ldquo;but I meant the path was rough. It
lies, all the way, by glade and dingle, and the dingles are
both deep and thorny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lead on,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Are you not Otto the Hunter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They had now burst across a veil of underwood, and
were come into a lawn among the forest, very green and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208"></a>208</span>
innocent, and solemnly surrounded by trees. Otto paused
on the margin, looking about him with delight; then his
glance returned to Seraphina, as she stood framed in that
silvan pleasantness and looking at her husband with undecipherable
eyes. A weakness both of the body and
mind fell on him like beginnings of sleep; the cords of his
activity were relaxed, his eyes clung to her. &ldquo;Let us rest,&rdquo;
he said; and he made her sit down, and himself sat down
beside her on the slope of an inconsiderable mound.</p>

<p>She sat with her eyes downcast, her slim hand dabbling
in grass, like a maid waiting for love&rsquo;s summons. The
sound of the wind in the forest swelled and sank, and drew
near them with a running rush, and died away and away
in the distance into fainting whispers. Nearer hand, a
bird out of the deep covert uttered broken and anxious
notes. All this seemed but a halting prelude to speech.
To Otto it seemed as if the whole frame of nature were
waiting for his words; and yet his pride kept him silent.
The longer he watched that slender and pale hand plucking
at the grasses, the harder and rougher grew the fight
between pride and its kindly adversary.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seraphina,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;it is right you should
know one thing: I never....&rdquo; He was about to say
&ldquo;doubted you,&rdquo; but was that true? And, if true, was it
generous to speak of it? Silence succeeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I pray you, tell it me,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;tell it me, in pity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean only this,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;that I understand
all, and do not blame you. I understand how the brave
woman must look down on the weak man. I think you
were wrong in some things; but I have tried to understand
it, and I do. I do not need to forget or to forgive,
Seraphina, for I have understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know what I have done,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am not
so weak that I can be deceived with kind speeches. I
know what I have been&mdash;I see myself. I am not worth
your anger, how much less to be forgiven! In all this downfall
and misery, I see only me and you: you, as you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"></a>209</span>
been always; me, as I was&mdash;me, above all! O yes, I see
myself; and what can I think?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, let us reverse the parts!&rdquo; said Otto. &ldquo;It
is ourselves we cannot forgive, when we deny forgiveness
to another&mdash;so a friend told me last night. On these
terms, Seraphina, you see how generously I have forgiven
myself. But am not <i>I</i> to be forgiven? Come, then,
forgive yourself&mdash;and me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not answer in words, but reached out her hand
to him quickly. He took it; and as the smooth fingers
settled and nestled in his, love ran to and fro between
them in tender and transforming currents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seraphina,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;O forget the past! Let me
serve and help you; let me be your servant; it is enough
for me to serve you and to be near you; let me be
near you, dear&mdash;do not send me away.&rdquo; He hurried his
pleading like the speech of a frightened child. &ldquo;It is
not love,&rdquo; he went on; &ldquo;I do not ask for love; my love
is enough....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Otto!&rdquo; she said, as if in pain.</p>

<p>He looked up into her face. It was wrung with the
very ecstasy of tenderness and anguish; on her features,
and most of all in her changed eyes, there shone the very
light of love.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seraphina?&rdquo; he cried aloud, and with a sudden,
tuneless voice, &ldquo;Seraphina?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look round you at this glade,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and where
the leaves are coming on young trees, and the flowers
begin to blossom. This is where we meet, meet for the
first time; it is so much better to forget and to be born
again. O what a pit there is for sins&mdash;God&rsquo;s mercy, man&rsquo;s
oblivion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seraphina,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;let it be so, indeed; let all
that was be merely the abuse of dreaming; let me begin
again, a stranger. I have dreamed in a long dream,
that I adored a girl unkind and beautiful; in all things my
superior, but still cold, like ice. And again I dreamed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210"></a>210</span>
and thought she changed and melted, glowed and turned
to me. And I&mdash;who had no merit but a love, slavish
and unerect&mdash;lay close, and durst not move for fear of
waking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie close,&rdquo; she said, with a deep thrill of speech.</p>

<p>So they spake in the spring woods; and meanwhile, in
Mittwalden Rath-haus, the Republic was declared.</p>

<h3>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL POSTSCRIPT</h3>
<h5>TO COMPLETE THE STORY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> reader well informed in modern history will not
require details as to the fate of the Republic. The best
account is to be found in the memoirs of Herr Greisengesang
(7 B√§nde: Leipzig), by our passing acquaintance the
licentiate Roederer. Herr Roederer, with too much of an
author&rsquo;s licence, makes a great figure of his hero&mdash;poses
him, indeed, to be the centrepiece and cloud-compeller of
the whole. But, with due allowance for this bias, the
book is able and complete.</p>

<p>The reader is of course acquainted with the vigorous
and bracing pages of Sir John (2 vols.: London: Longman,
Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown). Sir John, who plays
but a tooth-comb in the orchestra of this historical romance,
blows in his own book the big bassoon. His character
is there drawn at large; and the sympathy of Landor
has countersigned the admiration of the public. One
point, however, calls for explanation; the chapter on
Gr√ºnewald was torn by the hand of the author in the
palace gardens; how comes it, then, to figure at full
length among my more modest pages, the Lion of the caravan?
That eminent literatus was a man of method;
&ldquo;Juvenal by double entry,&rdquo; he was once profanely called;
and when he tore the sheets in question, it was rather, as
he has since explained, in the search for some dramatic
evidence of his sincerity, than with the thought of practical
deletion. At that time, indeed, he was possessed of two
blotted scrolls and a fair copy in double. But the chapter,
as the reader knows, was honestly omitted from the famous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"></a>212</span>
&ldquo;Memoirs on the various Courts of Europe.&rdquo; It has
been mine to give it to the public.</p>

<p>Bibliography still helps us with a further glimpse of
our characters. I have here before me a small volume
(printed for private circulation: no printer&rsquo;s name; n.d.),
&ldquo;Po√©sies par Fr√©d√©ric et Am√©lie.&rdquo; Mine is a presentation
copy, obtained for me by Mr. Bain in the Haymarket;
and the name of the first owner is written on the fly-leaf
in the hand of Prince Otto himself. The modest epigraph&mdash;&ldquo;Le
rime n&rsquo;est pas riche&rdquo;&mdash;may be attributed, with a
good show of likelihood, to the same collaborator. It is
strikingly appropriate, and I have found the volume very
dreary. Those pieces in which I seem to trace the hand
of the Princess are particularly dull and conscientious.
But the booklet had a fair success with that public for
which it was designed; and I have come across some
evidences of a second venture of the same sort, now unprocurable.
Here, at least, we may take leave of Otto
and Seraphina&mdash;what do I say? of Fr√©d√©ric and Am√©lie&mdash;ageing
together peaceably at the court of the wife&rsquo;s father,
jingling French rhymes and correcting joint proofs.</p>

<p>Still following the book-lists, I perceive that Mr. Swinburne
has dedicated a rousing lyric and some vigorous
sonnets to the memory of Gondremark; that name appears
twice at least in Victor Hugo&rsquo;s trumpet-blasts of patriot
enumeration; and I came latterly, when I supposed my
task already ended, on a trace of the fallen politician and
his Countess. It is in the &ldquo;Diary of J. Hogg Cotterill,
Esq.&rdquo; (that very interesting work). Mr. Cotterill, being
at Naples, is introduced (May 27th) to &ldquo;a Baron and
Baroness Gondremark&mdash;he a man who once made a noise&mdash;she
still beautiful&mdash;both witty. She complimented me
much upon my French&mdash;should never have known me
to be English&mdash;had known my uncle, Sir John, in Germany&mdash;recognised
in me, as a family trait, some of his <i>grand air</i>
and studious courtesy&mdash;asked me to call.&rdquo; And again
(May 30th), &ldquo;visited the Baronne de Gondremark&mdash;much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"></a>213</span>
gratified&mdash;a most <i>refined</i>, <i>intelligent</i> woman, quite of the
old school, now, <i>h√©las!</i> extinct&mdash;had read my &lsquo;Remarks
on Sicily&rsquo;&mdash;it reminds her of my uncle, but with more
of grace&mdash;I feared she thought there was less energy&mdash;assured
no&mdash;a softer style of presentation, more of the
<i>literary grace</i>, but the same first grasp of circumstance
and force of thought&mdash;in short, just Buttonhole&rsquo;s opinion.
Much encouraged. I have a real esteem for this patrician
lady.&rdquo; The acquaintance lasted some time; and when
Mr. Cotterill left in the suite of Lord Protocol, and, as
he is careful to inform us, in Admiral Yardarm&rsquo;s flagship,
one of his chief causes of regret is to leave &ldquo;that most
<i>spirituelle</i> and sympathetic lady, who already regards me
as a younger brother.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH MORRIS SUSPECTS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">How</span> very little does the amateur, dwelling at home at
ease, comprehend the labours and perils of the author,
and, when he smilingly skims the surface of a work of
fiction, how little does he consider the hours of toil, consultation
of authorities, researches in the Bodleian, correspondence
with learned and illegible Germans&mdash;in one
word, the vast scaffolding that was first built up and then
knocked down, to while away an hour for him in a railway
train! Thus I might begin this tale with a biography
of Tonti&mdash;birthplace, parentage, genius probably inherited
from his mother, remarkable instance of precocity, etc.&mdash;and
a complete treatise on the system to which he bequeathed
his name. The material is all beside me in a
pigeon-hole, but I scorn to appear vainglorious. Tonti
is dead, and I never saw anyone who even pretended to
regret him; and, as for the tontine system, a word will
suffice for all the purposes of this unvarnished narrative.</p>

<p>A number of sprightly youths (the more the merrier)
put up a certain sum of money, which is then funded in
a pool under trustees; coming on for a century later, the
proceeds are fluttered for a moment in the face of the last
survivor, who is probably deaf, so that he cannot even hear
of his success&mdash;and who is certainly dying, so that he
might just as well have lost. The peculiar poetry and even
humour of the scheme is now apparent, since it is one
by which nobody concerned can possibly profit; but its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"></a>220</span>
fine, sportsmanlike character endeared it to our grand-parents.</p>

<p>When Joseph Finsbury and his brother Masterman
were little lads in white-frilled trousers, their father&mdash;a
well-to-do merchant in Cheapside&mdash;caused them to join a
small but rich tontine of seven-and-thirty lives. A thousand
pounds was the entrance fee; and Joseph Finsbury can
remember to this day the visit to the lawyer&rsquo;s, where the
members of the tontine&mdash;all children like himself&mdash;were
assembled together, and sat in turn in the big office chair,
and signed their names with the assistance of a kind old
gentleman in spectacles and Wellington boots. He remembers
playing with the children afterwards on the
lawn at the back of the lawyer&rsquo;s house, and a battle-royal
that he had with a brother tontiner who had kicked his
shins. The sound of war called forth the lawyer from
where he was dispensing cake and wine to the assembled
parents in the office, and the combatants were separated,
and Joseph&rsquo;s spirit (for he was the smaller of the two)
commended by the gentleman in the Wellington boots,
who vowed he had been just such another at the same age.
Joseph wondered to himself if he had worn at that time
little Wellingtons and a little bald head, and when, in bed
at night, he grew tired of telling himself stories of sea-fights,
he used to dress himself up as the old gentleman, and
entertain other little boys and girls with cake and wine.</p>

<p>In the year 1840 the thirty-seven were all alive; in
1850 their number had decreased by six; in 1856 and
1857 business was more lively, for the Crimea and the
Mutiny carried off no less than nine. There remained in
1870 but five of the original members, and at the date of
my story, including the two Finsburys, but three.</p>

<p>By this time Masterman was in his seventy-third
year; he had long complained of the effects of age, had
long since retired from business, and now lived in absolute
seclusion under the roof of his son Michael, the well-known
solicitor. Joseph, on the other hand, was still up and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"></a>221</span>
about, and still presented but a semi-venerable figure on
the streets in which he loved to wander. This was the
more to be deplored because Masterman had led (even
to the least particular) a model British life. Industry,
regularity, respectability, and a preference for the four
per cents. are understood to be the very foundations of
a green old age. All these Masterman had eminently displayed,
and here he was, <i>ab agendo</i>, at seventy-three;
while Joseph, barely two years younger, and in the most
excellent preservation, had disgraced himself through life
by idleness and eccentricity. Embarked in the leather
trade, he had early wearied of business, for which he was
supposed to have small parts. A taste for general information,
not promptly checked, had soon begun to sap his
manhood. There is no passion more debilitating to the
mind, unless, perhaps, it be that itch of public speaking
which it not infrequently accompanies or begets. The
two were conjoined in the case of Joseph; the acute stage
of this double malady, that in which the patient delivers
gratuitous lectures, soon declared itself with severity,
and not many years had passed over his head before he
would have travelled thirty miles to address an infant school.
He was no student; his reading was confined to elementary
text-books and the daily papers; he did not even fly as
high as cyclop√¶dias; life, he would say, was his volume.
His lectures were not meant, he would declare, for college
professors; they were addressed direct to &ldquo;the great
heart of the people,&rdquo; and the heart of the people must
certainly be sounder than its head, for his lucubrations
were received with favour. That entitled, &ldquo;How to
Live Cheerfully on Forty Pounds a Year,&rdquo; created a
sensation among the unemployed. &ldquo;Education: Its
Aims, Objects, Purposes, and Desirability,&rdquo; gained him
the respect of the shallow-minded. As for his celebrated
essay on &ldquo;Life Insurance Regarded in its Relation to
the Masses,&rdquo; read before the Working Men&rsquo;s Mutual
Improvement Society, Isle of Dogs, it was received with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page222"></a>222</span>
a &ldquo;literal ovation&rdquo; by an unintelligent audience of both
sexes, and so marked was the effect that he was next year
elected honorary president of the institution, an office
of less than no emolument&mdash;since the holder was expected
to come down with a donation&mdash;but one which highly
satisfied his self-esteem.</p>

<p>While Joseph was thus building himself up a reputation
among the more cultivated portion of the ignorant,
his domestic life was suddenly overwhelmed by orphans.
The death of his younger brother Jacob saddled him with
the charge of two boys, Morris and John; and in the
course of the same year his family was still further swelled
by the addition of a little girl, the daughter of John Henry
Hazeltine, Esq., a gentleman of small property and fewer
friends. He had met Joseph only once, at a lecture-hall
in Holloway; but from that formative experience he
returned home to make a new will, and consign his daughter
and her fortune to the lecturer. Joseph had a kindly
disposition; and yet it was not without reluctance that
he accepted this new responsibility, advertised for a nurse,
and purchased a second-hand perambulator. Morris and
John he made more readily welcome; not so much because
of the tie of consanguinity as because the leather business
(in which he hastened to invest their fortune of thirty
thousand pounds) had recently exhibited inexplicable
symptoms of decline. A young but capable Scot was
chosen as manager to the enterprise, and the cares of
business never again afflicted Joseph Finsbury. Leaving
his charges in the hands of the capable Scot (who was
married), he began his extensive travels on the Continent
and in Asia Minor.</p>

<p>With a polyglot Testament in one hand and a phrase-book
in the other, he groped his way among the speakers
of eleven European languages. The first of these guides
is hardly applicable to the purposes of the philosophic
traveller, and even the second is designed more expressly
for the tourist than for the expert in life. But he pressed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"></a>223</span>
interpreters into his service&mdash;whenever he could get their
services for nothing&mdash;and by one means and another
filled many note-books with the results of his researches.</p>

<p>In these wanderings he spent several years, and only
returned to England when the increasing age of his charges
needed his attention. The two lads had been placed in a
good but economical school, where they had received a
sound commercial education; which was somewhat awkward,
as the leather business was by no means in a state
to court inquiry. In fact, when Joseph went over his
accounts preparatory to surrendering his trust, he was
dismayed to discover that his brother&rsquo;s fortune had not
increased by his stewardship; even by making over to his
two wards every penny he had in the world, there would
still be a deficit of seven thousand eight hundred pounds.
When these facts were communicated to the two brothers in
the presence of a lawyer, Morris Finsbury threatened his
uncle with all the terrors of the law, and was only prevented
from taking extreme steps by the advice of the
professional man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot get blood from a stone,&rdquo; observed the
lawyer.</p>

<p>And Morris saw the point and came to terms with his
uncle. On the one side, Joseph gave up all that he possessed,
and assigned to his nephew his contingent interest
in the tontine, already quite a hopeful speculation. On
the other, Morris agreed to harbour his uncle and Miss
Hazeltine (who had come to grief with the rest), and to
pay to each of them one pound a month as pocket-money.
The allowance was amply sufficient for the old man; it
scarce appears how Miss Hazeltine contrived to dress
upon it; but she did, and, what is more, she never complained.
She was, indeed, sincerely attached to her incompetent
guardian. He had never been unkind; his
age spoke for him loudly; there was something appealing
in his whole-souled quest of knowledge and innocent
delight in the smallest mark of admiration; and, though
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"></a>224</span>
the lawyer had warned her she was being sacrificed, Julia
had refused to add to the perplexities of Uncle Joseph.</p>

<p>In a large, dreary house in John Street, Bloomsbury,
these four dwelt together; a family in appearance, in
reality a financial association. Julia and Uncle Joseph were,
of course, slaves; John, a gentleman with a taste for the
banjo, the music-hall, the Gaiety bar, and the sporting
papers, must have been anywhere a secondary figure;
and the cares and delights of empire devolved entirely
upon Morris. That these are inextricably intermixed
is one of the commonplaces with which the bland essayist
consoles the incompetent and the obscure, but in the case
of Morris the bitter must have largely outweighed the
sweet. He grudged no trouble to himself, he spared none
to others; he called the servants in the morning, he served
out the stores with his own hand, he took soundings of the
sherry, he numbered the remainder biscuits; painful
scenes took place over the weekly bills, and the cook
was frequently impeached, and the tradespeople came
and hectored with him in the back parlour upon a question
of three farthings. The superficial might have deemed
him a miser; in his own eyes he was simply a man who
had been defrauded; the world owed him seven thousand
eight hundred pounds, and he intended that the world
should pay.</p>

<p>But it was in his dealings with Joseph that Morris&rsquo;s
character particularly shone. His uncle was a rather
gambling stock in which he had invested heavily; and he
spared no pains in nursing the security. The old man
was seen monthly by a physician, whether he was well or
ill. His diet, his raiment, his occasional outings, now to
Brighton, now to Bournemouth, were doled out to him
like pap to infants. In bad weather he must keep the
house. In good weather, by half-past nine, he must be
ready in the hall; Morris would see that he had gloves and
that his shoes were sound; and the pair would start for
the leather business arm in arm. The way there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225"></a>225</span>
probably dreary enough, for there was no pretence of
friendly feeling; Morris had never ceased to upbraid his
guardian with his defalcation and to lament the burthen of
Miss Hazeltine; and Joseph, though he was a mild enough
soul, regarded his nephew with something very near akin to
hatred. But the way there was nothing to the journey
back; for the mere sight of the place of business, as well as
every detail of its transactions, was enough to poison life
for any Finsbury.</p>

<p>Joseph&rsquo;s name was still over the door; it was he who
still signed the cheques; but this was only policy on the
part of Morris, and designed to discourage other members
of the tontine. In reality the business was entirely his;
and he found it an inheritance of sorrows. He tried to
sell it, and the offers he received were quite derisory. He
tried to extend it, and it was only the liabilities he succeeded
in extending; to restrict it, and it was only the
profits he managed to restrict. Nobody had ever made
money out of that concern except the capable Scot, who
retired (after his discharge) to the neighbourhood of Banff
and built a castle with his profits. The memory of this
fallacious Caledonian Morris would revile daily, as he sat
in the private office opening his mail, with old Joseph at
another table, sullenly awaiting orders, or savagely affixing
signatures to he knew not what. And when the man of
the heather pushed cynicism so far as to send him the
announcement of his second marriage (to Davida, eldest
daughter of the Rev. Alexander McCraw), it was really
supposed that Morris would have had a fit.</p>

<p>Business hours, in the Finsbury leather trade, had
been cut to the quick; even Morris&rsquo;s strong sense of duty
to himself was not strong enough to dally within those
walls and under the shadow of that bankruptcy; and
presently the manager and the clerks would draw a long
breath, and compose themselves for another day of
procrastination. Raw Haste, on the authority of my
Lord Tennyson, is half-sister to Delay; but the Business
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226"></a>226</span>
Habits are certainly her uncles. Meanwhile, the leather
merchant would lead his living investment back to John
Street like a puppy dog; and, having there immured him
in the hall, would depart for the day on the quest of seal
rings, the only passion of his life. Joseph had more than
the vanity of man, he had that of lecturers. He owned
he was in fault, although more sinned against (by the
capable Scot) than sinning; but had he steeped his hands
in gore, he would still not deserve to be thus dragged at
the chariot-wheels of a young man, to sit a captive in the
halls of his own leather business, to be entertained with
mortifying comments on his whole career&mdash;to have his
costume examined, his collar pulled up, the presence of his
mittens verified, and to be taken out and brought home
in custody, like an infant with a nurse. At the thought of it
his soul would swell with venom, and he would make haste
to hang up his hat and coat and the detested mittens, and
slink upstairs to Julia and his note-books. The drawing-room
at least was sacred from Morris; it belonged to the
old man and the young girl; it was there that she made her
dresses; it was there that he inked his spectacles over the
registration of disconnected facts and the calculation of
insignificant statistics.</p>

<p>Here he would sometimes lament his connection with
the tontine. &ldquo;If it were not for that,&rdquo; he cried one afternoon,
&ldquo;he would not care to keep me. I might be a free
man, Julia. And I could so easily support myself by
giving lectures.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure you could,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;and I think it
one of the meanest things he ever did to deprive you of that
amusement. There were those nice people at the Isle
of Cats (wasn&rsquo;t it?) who wrote and asked you so very
kindly to give them an address. I did think he might
have let you go to the Isle of Cats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is a man of no intelligence,&rdquo; cried Joseph. &ldquo;He
lives here literally surrounded by the absorbing spectacle
of life, and for all the good it does him, he might just as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227"></a>227</span>
well be in his coffin. Think of his opportunities! The
heart of any other young man would burn within him
at the chance. The amount of information that I have
it in my power to convey, if he would only listen, is a
thing that beggars language, Julia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whatever you do, my dear, you mustn&rsquo;t excite
yourself,&rdquo; said Julia; &ldquo;for you know, if you look at all
ill, the doctor will be sent for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; returned the old man humbly,
&ldquo;I will compose myself with a little study.&rdquo; He thumbed
his gallery of note-books. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
wonder (since I see your hands are occupied) whether
it might not interest you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course it would,&rdquo; cried Julia. &ldquo;Read me
one of your nice stories, there&rsquo;s a dear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had the volume down and his spectacles upon his nose
instanter, as though to forestall some possible retractation.
&ldquo;What I propose to read to you,&rdquo; said he, skimming
through the pages, &ldquo;is the notes of a highly important
conversation with a Dutch courier of the name of David
Abbas, which is the Latin for abbot. Its results are well
worth the money it cost me, for, as Abbas at first appeared
somewhat impatient, I was induced to (what is, I believe,
singularly called) stand him drink. It runs only to about
five-and-twenty pages. Yes, here it is.&rdquo; He cleared his
throat, and began to read.</p>

<p>Mr. Finsbury (according to his own report) contributed
about four hundred and ninety-nine five-hundredths of
the interview, and elicited from Abbas literally nothing.
It was dull for Julia, who did not require to listen; for the
Dutch courier, who had to answer, it must have been
a perfect nightmare. It would seem as if he had consoled
himself by frequent appliances to the bottle; it would
even seem that (toward the end) he had ceased to depend on
Joseph&rsquo;s frugal generosity and called for the flagon on
his own account. The effect, at least, of some mellowing
influence was visible in the record: Abbas became suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228"></a>228</span>
a willing witness; he began to volunteer disclosures; and
Julia had just looked up from her seam with something like
a smile, when Morris burst into the house, eagerly calling
for his uncle, and the next instant plunged into the room,
waving in the air the evening paper.</p>

<p>It was indeed with great news that he came charged.
The demise was announced of Lieutenant-General Sir
Glasgow Biggar, K.C.S.I., K.C.M.G., etc., and the prize of
the tontine now lay between the Finsbury brothers. Here
was Morris&rsquo;s opportunity at last. The brothers had
never, it is true, been cordial. When word came that
Joseph was in Asia Minor, Masterman had expressed
himself with irritation. &ldquo;I call it simply indecent,&rdquo; he
had said. &ldquo;Mark my words&mdash;we shall hear of him next
at the North Pole.&rdquo; And these bitter expressions had been
reported to the traveller on his return. What was worse,
Masterman had refused to attend the lecture on &ldquo;Education:
Its Aims, Objects, Purposes, and Desirability,&rdquo;
although invited to the platform. Since then the brothers
had not met. On the other hand, they never had openly
quarrelled; Joseph (by Morris&rsquo;s orders) was prepared to
waive the advantage of his juniority; Masterman had
enjoyed all through life the reputation of a man neither
greedy nor unfair. Here, then, were all the elements of
compromise assembled; and Morris, suddenly beholding
his seven thousand eight hundred pounds restored to him,
and himself dismissed from the vicissitudes of the leather
trade, hastened the next morning to the office of his cousin
Michael.</p>

<p>Michael was something of a public character. Launched
upon the law at a very early age, and quite without protectors,
he had become a trafficker in shady affairs. He
was known to be the man for a lost cause; it was known
he could extract testimony from a stone, and interest from
a gold mine; and his office was besieged in consequence
by all that numerous class of persons who have still some
reputation to lose, and find themselves upon the point of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229"></a>229</span>
losing it; by those who have made undesirable acquaintances,
who have mislaid a compromising correspondence,
or who are blackmailed by their own butlers. In private
life Michael was a man of pleasure; but it was thought
his dire experience at the office had gone far to sober him,
and it was known that (in the matter of investments) he
preferred the solid to the brilliant. What was yet more
to the purpose, he had been all his life a consistent scoffer
at the Finsbury tontine.</p>

<p>It was therefore with little fear for the result that
Morris presented himself before his cousin, and proceeded
feverishly to set forth his scheme. For near upon a
quarter of an hour the lawyer suffered him to dwell upon
its manifest advantages uninterrupted. Then Michael
rose from his seat, and, ringing for his clerk, uttered a
single clause:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Morris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was in vain that the leather merchant pleaded and
reasoned, and returned day after day to plead and reason.
It was in vain that he offered a bonus of one thousand, of
two thousand, of three thousand pounds; in vain that he
offered, in Joseph&rsquo;s name, to be content with only one-third
of the pool. Still there came the same answer:
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t see the bottom of this,&rdquo; he said at last. &ldquo;You
answer none of my arguments; you haven&rsquo;t a word to
say. For my part, I believe it&rsquo;s malice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lawyer smiled at him benignly. &ldquo;You may
believe one thing,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Whatever else I do, I am
not going to gratify any of your curiosity. You see I am
a trifle more communicative to-day, because this is our
last interview upon the subject.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our last interview!&rdquo; cried Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stirrup-cup, dear boy,&rdquo; returned Michael. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t have my business hours encroached upon. And,
by the by, have you no business of your own? Are there
no convulsions in the leather trade?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page230"></a>230</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe it to be malice,&rdquo; repeated Morris doggedly.
&ldquo;You always hated and despised me from a boy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;not hated,&rdquo; returned Michael soothingly.
&ldquo;I rather like you than otherwise; there&rsquo;s such a permanent
surprise about you, you look so dark and attractive
from a distance. Do you know that to the naked
eye you look romantic?&mdash;like what they call a man with
a history? And indeed, from all that I can hear, the
history of the leather trade is full of incident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morris, disregarding these remarks, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
no use coming here. I shall see your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O no, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;Nobody shall
see my father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know why,&rdquo; cried his cousin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never make any secret of that,&rdquo; replied the lawyer.
&ldquo;He is too ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he is as ill as you say,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;the
more reason for accepting my proposal. I <i>will</i> see
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; said Michael, and he rose and rang for
his clerk.</p>

<p>It was now time, according to Sir Faraday Bond,
the medical baronet whose name is so familiar at the
foot of bulletins, that Joseph (the poor Golden Goose)
should be removed into the purer air of Bournemouth;
and for that uncharted wilderness of villas the family
now shook off the dust of Bloomsbury; Julia delighted,
because at Bournemouth she sometimes made acquaintances;
John in despair, for he was a man of city tastes;
Joseph indifferent where he was, so long as there was
pen and ink and daily papers, and he could avoid martyrdom
at the office; Morris himself, perhaps, not displeased
to pretermit these visits to the city, and have a quiet time
for thought. He was prepared for any sacrifice; all he
desired was to get his money again and clear his feet of
leather; and it would be strange, since he was so modest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page231"></a>231</span>
in his desires, and the pool amounted to upward of a
hundred and sixteen thousand pounds&mdash;it would be strange
indeed if he could find no way of influencing Michael. &ldquo;If
I could only guess his reason,&rdquo; he repeated to himself;
and by day, as he walked in Branksome Woods, and by
night, as he turned upon his bed, and at meal-times, when
he forgot to eat, and in the bathing machine, when he
forgot to dress himself, that problem was constantly before
him: Why had Michael refused?</p>

<p>At last, one night, he burst into his brother&rsquo;s room
and woke him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Julia leaves this place to-morrow,&rdquo; replied Morris.
&ldquo;She must go up to town and get the house ready, and
find servants. We shall all follow in three days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, brayvo!&rdquo; cried John. &ldquo;But why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found it out, John,&rdquo; returned his brother
gently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It? What?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Michael won&rsquo;t compromise,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
because he can&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s because Masterman&rsquo;s dead, and
he&rsquo;s keeping it dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Golly!&rdquo; cried the impressionable John. &ldquo;But
what&rsquo;s the use? Why does he do it, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To defraud us of the tontine,&rdquo; said his brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t; you have to have a doctor&rsquo;s certificate,&rdquo;
objected John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you never hear of venal doctors?&rdquo; inquired
Morris. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re as common as blackberries: you can
pick &rsquo;em up for three-pound-ten a head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t do it under fifty if I were a sawbones,&rdquo;
ejaculated John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then Michael,&rdquo; continued Morris, &ldquo;is in the very
thick of it. All his clients have come to grief; his whole
business is rotten eggs. If any man could arrange it,
he could; and depend upon it, he has his plan all straight;
and depend upon it, it&rsquo;s a good one, for he&rsquo;s clever, and be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232"></a>232</span>
damned to him! But I&rsquo;m clever too; and I&rsquo;m desperate.
I lost seven thousand eight hundred pounds when I was
an orphan at school.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t be tedious,&rdquo; interrupted John. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
lost far more already trying to get it back.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH MORRIS TAKES ACTION</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Some</span> days later, accordingly, the three males of this
depressing family might have been observed (by a reader
of G. P. R. James) taking their departure from the East
Station of Bournemouth. The weather was raw and
changeable, and Joseph was arrayed in consequence according
to the principles of Sir Faraday Bond, a man no less
strict (as is well known) on costume than on diet. There
are few polite invalids who have not lived, or tried to
live, by that punctilious physician&rsquo;s orders. &ldquo;Avoid tea,
madam,&rdquo; the reader has doubtless heard him say, &ldquo;avoid
tea, fried liver, antimonial wine, and bakers&rsquo; bread. Retire
nightly at 10.45; and clothe yourself (if you please)
throughout in hygienic flannel. Externally, the fur of the
marten is indicated. Do not forget to procure a pair of
health boots at Messrs. Dall and Crumbie&rsquo;s.&rdquo; And he
has probably called you back, even after you have paid
your fee, to add with stentorian emphasis: &ldquo;I had forgotten
one caution: avoid kippered sturgeon as you would
the very devil!&rdquo; The unfortunate Joseph was cut to the
pattern of Sir Faraday in every button; he was shod with
the health boot; his suit was of genuine ventilating cloth;
his shirt of hygienic flannel, a somewhat dingy fabric;
and he was draped to the knees in the inevitable greatcoat of
marten&rsquo;s fur. The very railway porters at Bournemouth
(which was a favourite station of the doctor&rsquo;s) marked
the old gentleman for a creature of Sir Faraday. There
was but one evidence of personal taste, a vizarded forage-cap;
from this form of headpiece, since he had fled from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"></a>234</span>
a dying jackal on the plains of Ephesus, and weathered a
bora in the Adriatic, nothing could divorce our traveller.</p>

<p>The three Finsburys mounted into their compartment,
and fell immediately to quarrelling, a step unseemly in
itself and (in this case) highly unfortunate for Morris.
Had he lingered a moment longer by the window, this
tale need never have been written. For he might then
have observed (as the porters did not fail to do) the arrival
of a second passenger in the uniform of Sir Faraday Bond.
But he had other matters on hand, which he judged (God
knows how erroneously) to be more important.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never heard of such a thing,&rdquo; he cried, resuming
a discussion which had scarcely ceased all morning. &ldquo;The
bill is not yours; it is mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is payable to me,&rdquo; returned the old gentleman,
with an air of bitter obstinacy. &ldquo;I will do what I please
with my own property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bill was one for eight hundred pounds, which
had been given him at breakfast to endorse, and which
he had simply pocketed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear him, Johnny!&rdquo; cried Morris. &ldquo;His property!
the very clothes upon his back belong to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let him alone,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I am sick of both of
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is no way to speak of your uncle, sir,&rdquo; cried
Joseph. &ldquo;I will not endure this disrespect. You are
a pair of exceedingly forward, impudent, and ignorant
young men, and I have quite made up my mind to put
an end to the whole business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O skittles!&rdquo; said the graceful John.</p>

<p>But Morris was not so easy in his mind. This unusual
act of insubordination had already troubled him; and
these mutinous words now sounded ominously in his
ears. He looked at the old gentleman uneasily. Upon
one occasion, many years before, when Joseph was delivering
a lecture, the audience had revolted in a body; finding
their entertainer somewhat dry, they had taken the question
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235"></a>235</span>
of amusement into their own hands; and the lecturer
(along with the board schoolmaster, the Baptist clergyman,
and a working-man&rsquo;s candidate, who made up his bodyguard)
was ultimately driven from the scene. Morris
had not been present on that fatal day; if he had, he would
have recognised a certain fighting glitter in his uncle&rsquo;s
eye, and a certain chewing movement of his lips, as old
acquaintances. But even to the inexpert these symptoms
breathed of something dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;I have no wish to bother
you further till we get to London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph did not so much as look at him in answer;
with tremulous hands he produced a copy of the <i>British
Mechanic</i>, and ostentatiously buried himself in its perusal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what can make him so cantankerous?&rdquo;
reflected the nephew. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the look of it at all.&rdquo;
And he dubiously scratched his nose.</p>

<p>The train travelled forth into the world, bearing along
with it the customary freight of obliterated voyagers, and
along with these old Joseph, affecting immersion in his
paper, and John slumbering over the columns of the
<i>Pink Un</i>, and Morris revolving in his mind a dozen grudges,
and suspicions, and alarms. It passed Christ Church
by the sea, Herne with its pinewoods, Ringwood on its
mazy river. A little behind time, but not much for the
South-Western, it drew up at the platform of a station,
in the midst of the New Forest, the real name of which
(in case the railway company &ldquo;might have the law of
me&ldquo;) I shall veil under the <i>alias</i> of Browndean.</p>

<p>Many passengers put their heads to the window, and
among the rest an old gentleman on whom I willingly
dwell, for I am nearly done with him now, and (in the
whole course of the present narrative) I am not in the
least likely to meet another character so decent. His
name is immaterial, not so his habits. He had passed
his life wandering in a tweed suit on the continent of
Europe; and years of <i>Galignani&rsquo;s Messenger</i> having at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236"></a>236</span>
length undermined his eyesight, he suddenly remembered
the rivers of Assyria and came to London to consult an
oculist. From the oculist to the dentist, and from both
to the physician, the step appears inevitable; presently
he was in the hands of Sir Faraday, robed in ventilating
cloth and sent to Bournemouth; and to that domineering
baronet (who was his only friend upon his native
soil) he was now returning to report. The case of these
tweed-suited wanderers is unique. We have all seen them
entering the table d&rsquo;h√¥te (at Spezzia, or Gr√§tz, or Venice)
with a genteel melancholy and a faint appearance of having
been to India and not succeeded. In the offices of many
hundred hotels they are known by name; and yet, if
the whole of this wandering cohort were to disappear tomorrow,
their absence would be wholly unremarked. How
much more, if only one&mdash;say this one in the ventilating
cloth&mdash;should vanish! He had paid his bills at Bournemouth;
his worldly effects were all in the van in two portmanteaux,
and these after the proper interval would be
sold as unclaimed baggage to a Jew; Sir Faraday&rsquo;s butler
would be a half-crown poorer at the year&rsquo;s end, and the
hotel-keepers of Europe about the same date would be
mourning a small but quite observable decline in profits.
And that would be literally all. Perhaps the old gentleman
thought something of the sort, for he looked melancholy
enough as he pulled his bare, grey head back into
the carriage, and the train smoked under the bridge, and
forth, with ever quickening speed, across the mingled
heaths and woods of the New Forest.</p>

<p>Not many hundred yards beyond Browndean, however,
a sudden jarring of brakes set everybody&rsquo;s teeth on
edge, and there was a brutal stoppage. Morris Finsbury
was aware of a confused uproar of voices, and sprang to
the window. Women were screaming, men were tumbling
from the windows on the track, the guard was crying
to them to stay where they were; at the same time the
train began to gather way and move very slowly backward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page237"></a>237</span>
toward Browndean; and the next moment, all these
various sounds were blotted out in the apocalyptic whistle
and the thundering onslaught of the down express.</p>

<p>The actual collision Morris did not hear. Perhaps he
fainted. He had a wild dream of having seen the carriage
double up and fall to pieces like a pantomime trick; and
sure enough, when he came to himself, he was lying on
the bare earth and under the open sky. His head ached
savagely; he carried his hand to his brow, and was not
surprised to see it red with blood. The air was filled with
an intolerable, throbbing roar, which he expected to find
die away with the return of consciousness; and instead of
that it seemed but to swell the louder and to pierce the
more cruelly through his ears. It was a raging, bellowing
thunder, like a boiler-riveting factory.</p>

<p>And now curiosity began to stir, and he sat up and
looked about him. The track at this point ran in a sharp
curve about a wooded hillock; all of the near side was
heaped with the wreckage of the Bournemouth train;
that of the express was mostly hidden by the trees; and
just at the turn, under clouds of vomiting steam and piled
about with cairns of living coal, lay what remained of the
two engines, one upon the other. On the heathy margin
of the line were many people running to and fro, and
crying aloud as they ran, and many others lying motionless
like sleeping tramps.</p>

<p>Morris suddenly drew an inference. &ldquo;There has been
an accident!&rdquo; thought he, and was elated at his perspicacity.
Almost at the same time his eye lighted on John,
who lay close by as white as paper. &ldquo;Poor old John!
poor old cove!&rdquo; he thought, the schoolboy expression
popping forth from some forgotten treasury, and he took
his brother&rsquo;s hand in his with childish tenderness. It
was perhaps the touch that recalled him; at least John
opened his eyes, sat suddenly up, and after several ineffectual
movements of his lips, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row?&rdquo; said
he, in a phantom voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page238"></a>238</span></p>

<p>The din of that devil&rsquo;s smithy still thundered in their
ears. &ldquo;Let us get away from that,&rdquo; Morris cried, and
pointed to the vomit of steam that still spouted from the
broken engines. And the pair helped each other up,
and stood and quaked and wavered and stared about them
at the scene of death.</p>

<p>Just then they were approached by a party of men
who had already organised themselves for the purposes
of rescue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt?&rdquo; cried one of these, a young fellow
with the sweat streaming down his pallid face, and who,
by the way he was treated, was evidently the doctor.</p>

<p>Morris shook his head, and the young man, nodding
grimly, handed him a bottle of some spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take a drink of that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;your friend looks
as if he needed it badly. We want every man we can
get,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s terrible work before us, and
nobody should shirk. If you can do no more, you can
carry a stretcher.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor was hardly gone before Morris, under the
spur of the dram, awoke to the full possession of his wits.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Uncle Joseph!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;where can he be? He can&rsquo;t be
far off. I hope the old party isn&rsquo;t damaged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come and help me to look,&rdquo; said Morris, with a
snap of savage determination strangely foreign to his
ordinary bearing; and then, for one moment, he broke
forth. &ldquo;If he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo; he cried, and shook his fist at
heaven.</p>

<p>To and fro the brothers hurried, staring in the faces
of the wounded, or turning the dead upon their backs.
They must have thus examined forty people, and still
there was no word of Uncle Joseph. But now the course
of their search brought them near the centre of the collision,
where the boilers were still blowing off steam with a deafening
clamour. It was a part of the field not yet gleaned
by the rescuing party. The ground, especially on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239"></a>239</span>
margin of the wood, was full of inequalities&mdash;here a pit,
there a hillock surmounted with a bush of furze. It was
a place where many bodies might lie concealed, and they
beat it like pointers after game. Suddenly Morris, who
was leading, paused and reached forth his index with a
tragic gesture. John followed the direction of his brother&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>In the bottom of a sandy hole lay something that
had once been human. The face had suffered severely,
and it was unrecognisable; but that was not required.
The snowy hair, the coat of marten, the ventilating cloth,
the hygienic flannel&mdash;everything down to the health boots
from Messrs. Dall and Crumbie&rsquo;s, identified the body as
that of Uncle Joseph. Only the forage-cap must have
been lost in the convulsion, for the dead man was bare-headed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The poor old beggar!&rdquo; said John, with a touch of
natural feeling; &ldquo;I would give ten pounds if we hadn&rsquo;t
chivied him in the train!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no sentiment in the face of Morris as
he gazed upon the dead. Gnawing his nails, with introverted
eyes, his brow marked with the stamp of tragic
indignation and tragic intellectual effort, he stood there
silent. Here was a last injustice; he had been robbed
while he was an orphan at school, he had been lashed to
a decadent leather business, he had been saddled with
Miss Hazeltine, his cousin had been defrauding him of the
tontine, and he had borne all this, we might almost say,
with dignity, and now they had gone and killed his uncle!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; he said suddenly, &ldquo;take his heels, we must
get him into the woods. I&rsquo;m not going to have anybody
find this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, fudge!&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what I tell you,&rdquo; spirted Morris, as he took the
corpse by the shoulders. &ldquo;Am I to carry him myself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were close upon the borders of the wood; in
ten or twelve paces they were under cover; and a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240"></a>240</span>
farther back, in a sandy clearing of the trees, they laid
their burthen down, and stood and looked at it with
loathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo; whispered John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bury him, to be sure!&rdquo; responded Morris, and he
opened his pocket-knife and began feverishly to dig.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never make a hand of it with that,&rdquo; objected
the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t help me, you cowardly shirk,&rdquo; screamed
Morris, &ldquo;you can go to the devil!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the childishest folly,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;but no man
shall call me a coward,&rdquo; and he began to help his brother
grudgingly.</p>

<p>The soil was sandy and light, but matted with the
roots of the surrounding firs. Gorse tore their hands;
and as they baled the sand from the grave, it was often
discoloured with their blood. An hour passed of unremitting
energy upon the part of Morris, of lukewarm
help on that of John; and still the trench was barely
nine inches in depth. Into this the body was rudely
flung: sand was piled upon it, and then more sand must
be dug, and gorse had to be cut to pile on that; and still
from one end of the sordid mound a pair of feet projected
and caught the light upon their patent-leather toes. But
by this time the nerves of both were shaken; even Morris
had enough of his grisly task; and they skulked off
like animals into the thickest of the neighbouring
covert.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the best that we can do,&rdquo; said Morris, sitting
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;perhaps you&rsquo;ll have the
politeness to tell me what it&rsquo;s all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried Morris, &ldquo;if you do not understand
for yourself, I almost despair of telling you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, of course it&rsquo;s some rot about the tontine,&rdquo; returned
the other. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s the merest nonsense. We&rsquo;ve
lost it, and there&rsquo;s an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"></a>241</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you,&rdquo; said Morris, &ldquo;Uncle Masterman is dead.
I know it, there&rsquo;s a voice that tells me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and so is Uncle Joseph,&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not dead, unless I choose,&rdquo; returned Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And come to that,&rdquo; cried John, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re right, and
Uncle Masterman&rsquo;s been dead ever so long, all we have
to do is to tell the truth and expose Michael.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to think Michael is a fool,&rdquo; sneered Morris.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you understand he&rsquo;s been preparing this fraud
for years? He has the whole thing ready: the nurse,
the doctor, the undertaker, all bought, the certificate all
ready but the date! Let him get wind of this business,
and you mark my words, Uncle Masterman will die in two
days and be buried in a week. But see here, Johnny; what
Michael can do, I can do. If he plays a game of bluff, so
can I. If his father is to live for ever, by God, so shall
my uncle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s illegal, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; said John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man must have <i>some</i> moral courage,&rdquo; replied Morris
with dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then suppose you&rsquo;re wrong? Suppose Uncle
Masterman&rsquo;s alive and kicking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, even then,&rdquo; responded the plotter, &ldquo;we are
no worse off than we were before; in fact, we&rsquo;re better.
Uncle Masterman must die some day; as long as Uncle
Joseph was alive, he might have died any day; but we&rsquo;re
out of all that trouble now: there&rsquo;s no sort of limit to the
game that I propose&mdash;it can be kept up till Kingdom
Come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I could only see how you meant to set about it!&rdquo;
sighed John. &ldquo;But you know, Morris, you always were
such a bungler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to know what I ever bungled,&rdquo; cried Morris;
&ldquo;I have the best collection of signet rings in London.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, there&rsquo;s the leather business,&rdquo;
suggested the other.  &ldquo;That&rsquo;s considered rather a
hash.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page242"></a>242</span></p>

<p>It was a mark of singular self-control in Morris that
he suffered this to pass unchallenged, and even unresented.</p>

<p>&ldquo;About the business in hand,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;once we
can get him up to Bloomsbury, there&rsquo;s no sort of trouble.
We bury him in the cellar, which seems made for it; and
then all I have to do is to start out and find a venal
doctor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we leave him where he is?&rdquo; asked John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we know nothing about the country,&rdquo; retorted
Morris. &ldquo;This wood may be a regular lovers&rsquo;
walk. Turn your mind to the real difficulty. How are
we to get him up to Bloomsbury?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Various schemes were mooted and rejected. The
railway station at Browndean was, of course, out of the
question, for it would now be a centre of curiosity and
gossip, and (of all things) they would be least able to
despatch a dead body without remark. John feebly
proposed getting an ale-cask and sending it as beer, but
the objections to this course were so overwhelming that
Morris scorned to answer. The purchase of a packing-case
seemed equally hopeless, for why should two gentlemen
without baggage of any kind require a packing-case?
They would be more likely to require clean linen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are working on wrong lines,&rdquo; cried Morris at
last. &ldquo;The thing must be gone about more carefully.
Suppose now,&rdquo; he added excitedly, speaking by fits and
starts, as if he were thinking aloud, &ldquo;suppose we rent a
cottage by the month. A householder can buy a packing-case
without remark. Then suppose we clear the people
out to-day, get the packing-case to-night, and to-morrow
I hire a carriage&mdash;or a cart that we could drive ourselves&mdash;and
take the box, or whatever we get, to Ringwood or
Lyndhurst or somewhere; we could label it &lsquo;specimens,&rsquo;
don&rsquo;t you see? Johnny, I believe I&rsquo;ve hit the nail at last.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it sounds more feasible,&rdquo; admitted John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we must take assumed names,&rdquo; continued
Morris. &ldquo;It would never do to keep our own. What
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243"></a>243</span>
do you say to &lsquo;Masterman&rsquo; itself? It sounds quiet and
dignified.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will <i>not</i> take the name of Masterman,&rdquo; returned
his brother; &ldquo;you may, if you like. I shall call myself
Vance&mdash;the Great Vance; positively the last six nights.
There&rsquo;s some go in a name like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Vance!&rdquo; cried Morris. &ldquo;Do you think we are playing
a pantomime for our amusement? There was never
anybody named Vance who wasn&rsquo;t a music-hall singer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the beauty of it,&rdquo; returned John; &ldquo;it gives
you some standing at once. You may call yourself Fortescue
till all&rsquo;s blue, and nobody cares; but to be Vance
gives a man a natural nobility.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s lots of other theatrical names,&rdquo; cried
Morris. &ldquo;Leybourne, Irving, Brough, Toole&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Devil a one will I take!&rdquo; returned his brother.
&ldquo;I am going to have my little lark out of this as well
as you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Morris, who perceived that John
was determined to carry his point, &ldquo;I shall be Robert
Vance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I shall be George Vance,&rdquo; cried John, &ldquo;the only
original George Vance! Rally round the only original!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Repairing as well as they were able the disorder of
their clothes, Finsbury brothers returned to Browndean
by a circuitous route in quest of luncheon and a suitable
cottage. It is not always easy to drop at a moment&rsquo;s notice
on a furnished residence in a retired locality; but fortune
presently introduced our adventurers to a deaf carpenter,
a man rich in cottages of the required description, and
unaffectedly eager to supply their wants. The second
place they visited, standing, as it did, about a mile and
a half from any neighbours, caused them to exchange a
glance of hope. On a nearer view, the place was not
without depressing features. It stood in a marshy-looking
hollow of a heath; tall trees obscured its windows; the
thatch visibly rotted on the rafters; and the walls were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244"></a>244</span>
stained with splashes of unwholesome green. The rooms
were small, the ceilings low, the furniture merely nominal;
a strange chill and a haunting smell of damp pervaded the
kitchen; and the bedroom boasted only of one bed.</p>

<p>Morris, with a view to cheapening the place, remarked
on this defect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned the man, &ldquo;if you can&rsquo;t sleep two
abed, you&rsquo;d better take a villa residence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then,&rdquo; pursued Morris, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no water. How
do you get your water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We fill <i>that</i> from the spring,&rdquo; replied the carpenter,
pointing to a big barrel that stood beside the door. &ldquo;The
spring ain&rsquo;t so <i>very</i> far off, after all, and it&rsquo;s easy brought
in buckets. There&rsquo;s a bucket there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris nudged his brother as they examined the water-butt.
It was new, and very solidly constructed for its
office. If anything had been wanting to decide them,
this eminently practical barrel would have turned the
scale. A bargain was promptly struck, the month&rsquo;s rent
was paid upon the nail, and about an hour later Finsbury
brothers might have been observed returning to the blighted
cottage, having along with them the key, which was the
symbol of their tenancy, a spirit-lamp, with which they
fondly told themselves they would be able to cook, a
pork pie of suitable dimensions, and a quart of the worst
whisky in Hampshire. Nor was this all they had effected;
already (under the plea that they were landscape-painters)
they had hired for dawn on the morrow a light but solid
two-wheeled cart; so that when they entered in their
new character, they were able to tell themselves that the
back of the business was already broken.</p>

<p>John proceeded to get tea; while Morris, foraging
about the house, was presently delighted by discovering
the lid of the water-butt upon the kitchen shelf. Here,
then, was the packing-case complete; in the absence of
straw, the blankets (which he himself, at least, had not
the smallest intention of using for their present purpose)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page245"></a>245</span>
would exactly take the place of packing; and Morris,
as the difficulties began to vanish from his path, rose
almost to the brink of exultation. There was, however,
one difficulty not yet faced, one upon which his whole
scheme depended. Would John consent to remain alone
in the cottage? He had not yet dared to put the question.</p>

<p>It was with high good-humour that the pair sat down
to the deal table, and proceeded to fall-to on the pork
pie. Morris retailed the discovery of the lid, and the
Great Vance was pleased to applaud by beating on the
table with his fork in true music-hall style.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the dodge,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I always said a
water-butt was what you wanted for this business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Morris, thinking this a favourable
opportunity to prepare his brother, &ldquo;of course you must
stay on in this place till I give the word; I&rsquo;ll give out
that uncle is resting in the New Forest. It would not
do for both of us to appear in London; we could never
conceal the absence of the old man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John&rsquo;s jaw dropped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, come!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You can stay in this hole
yourself. I won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colour came into Morris&rsquo;s cheeks. He saw that
he must win his brother at any cost.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must please remember, Johnny,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
amount of the tontine. If I succeed, we shall have each
fifty thousand to place to our bank account; ay, and
nearer sixty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if you fail,&rdquo; returned John, &ldquo;what then? What&rsquo;ll
be the colour of our bank account in that case?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will pay all expenses,&rdquo; said Morris, with an inward
struggle; &ldquo;you shall lose nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said John, with a laugh, &ldquo;if the ex-s are
yours, and half-profits mine, I don&rsquo;t mind remaining here
for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A couple of days!&rdquo; cried Morris, who was beginning
to get angry and controlled himself with difficulty;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page246"></a>246</span>
&ldquo;why, you would do more to win five pounds on a horse-race!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I would,&rdquo; returned the Great Vance; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the artistic temperament.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is monstrous!&rdquo; burst out Morris. &ldquo;I take
all risks; I pay all expenses; I divide profits; and you
won&rsquo;t take the slightest pains to help me. It&rsquo;s not decent;
it&rsquo;s not honest; it&rsquo;s not even kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose,&rdquo; objected John, who was considerably
impressed by his brother&rsquo;s vehemence, &ldquo;suppose that
Uncle Masterman is alive after all, and lives ten years
longer; must I rot here all that time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; responded Morris, in a more conciliatory
tone; &ldquo;I only ask a month at the outside;
and if Uncle Masterman is not dead by that time you
can go abroad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go abroad?&rdquo; repeated John eagerly.  &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t I go at once? Tell &rsquo;em that Joseph and I
are seeing life in Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, but look here,&rdquo; said John; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s this house,
it&rsquo;s such a pig-sty, it&rsquo;s so dreary and damp. You said
yourself that it was damp.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only to the carpenter,&rdquo; Morris distinguished, &ldquo;and
that was to reduce the rent. But really, you know, now
we&rsquo;re in it, I&rsquo;ve seen worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what am I to do?&rdquo; complained the victim.
&ldquo;How can I entertain a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Johnny, if you don&rsquo;t think the tontine
worth a little trouble, say so, and I&rsquo;ll give the business up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re dead certain of the figures, I suppose?&rdquo;
asked John. &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;with a deep sigh&mdash;&ldquo;send me the
<i>Pink Un</i> and all the comic papers regularly. I&rsquo;ll face
the music.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As afternoon drew on, the cottage breathed more
thrillingly of its native marsh; a creeping chill inhabited
its chambers; the fire smoked, and a shower of rain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247"></a>247</span>
coming up from the channel on a slant of wind, tingled
on the window-panes. At intervals, when the gloom
deepened toward despair, Morris would produce the
whisky-bottle, and at first John welcomed the diversion&mdash;not
for long. It has been said this spirit was the worst
in Hampshire; only those acquainted with the county
can appreciate the force of that superlative; and at
length even the Great Vance (who was no connoisseur)
waved the decoction from his lips. The approach of
dusk, feebly combated with a single tallow candle, added
a touch of tragedy; and John suddenly stopped whistling
through his fingers&mdash;an art to the practice of which he
had been reduced&mdash;and bitterly lamented his concessions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stay here a month,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;No one
could. The thing&rsquo;s nonsense, Morris. The parties that
lived in the Bastille would rise against a place like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With an admirable affectation of indifference, Morris
proposed a game of pitch-and-toss. To what will not
the diplomatist condescend! It was John&rsquo;s favourite
game; indeed his only game&mdash;he had found all the rest
too intellectual&mdash;and he played it with equal skill and
good fortune. To Morris himself, on the other hand, the
whole business was detestable; he was a bad pitcher,
he had no luck in tossing, and he was one who suffered
torments when he lost. But John was in a dangerous
humour, and his brother was prepared for any sacrifice.</p>

<p>By seven o&rsquo;clock, Morris, with incredible agony, had
lost a couple of half-crowns. Even with the tontine
before his eyes, this was as much as he could bear; and,
remarking that he would take his revenge some other
time, he proposed a bit of supper and a grog.</p>

<p>Before they had made an end of this refreshment it
was time to be at work. A bucket of water for present
necessities was withdrawn from the water-butt, which
was then emptied and rolled before the kitchen fire to
dry; and the two brothers set forth on their adventure
under a starless heaven.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>

<h5>THE LECTURER AT LARGE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Whether</span> mankind is really partial to happiness is an
open question. Not a month passes by but some cherished
son runs off into the merchant service, or some valued
husband decamps to Texas with a lady help; clergymen
have fled from their parishioners; and even judges
have been known to retire. To an open mind, it will
appear (upon the whole) less strange that Joseph Finsbury
should have been led to entertain ideas of escape. His
lot (I think we may say) was not a happy one. My friend,
Mr. Morris, with whom I travel up twice or thrice a week
from Snaresbrook Park, is certainly a gentleman whom
I esteem; but he was scarce a model nephew. As for
John, he is of course an excellent fellow; but if he was
the only link that bound one to a home, I think the most
of us would vote for foreign travel. In the case of Joseph,
John (if he were a link at all) was not the only one; endearing
bonds had long enchained the old gentleman to Bloomsbury;
and by these expressions I do not in the least refer
to Julia Hazeltine (of whom, however, he was fond enough),
but to that collection of manuscript note-books in which his
life lay buried. That he should ever have made up his
mind to separate himself from these collections, and go
forth upon the world with no other resources than his
memory supplied, is a circumstance highly pathetic in
itself, and but little creditable to the wisdom of his
nephews.</p>

<p>The design, or at least the temptation, was already
some months old; and when a bill for eight hundred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249"></a>249</span>
pounds, payable to himself, was suddenly placed in Joseph&rsquo;s
hand, it brought matters to an issue. He retained that
bill, which, to one of his frugality, meant wealth; and
he promised himself to disappear among the crowds at
Waterloo, or (if that should prove impossible) to slink
out of the house in the course of the evening and melt
like a dream into the millions of London. By a peculiar
interposition of Providence and railway mismanagement he
had not so long to wait.</p>

<p>He was one of the first to come to himself and scramble
to his feet after the Browndean catastrophe, and he had
no sooner remarked his prostrate nephews than he understood
his opportunity and fled. A man of upwards of
seventy, who has just met with a railway accident, and
who is cumbered besides with the full uniform of Sir Faraday
Bond, is not very likely to flee far, but the wood was
close at hand and offered the fugitive at least a temporary
covert. Hither, then, the old gentleman skipped with
extraordinary expedition, and, being somewhat winded
and a good deal shaken, here he lay down in a convenient
grove and was presently overwhelmed by slumber. The
way of fate is often highly entertaining to the looker-on, and
it is certainly a pleasant circumstance, that while Morris
and John were delving in the sand to conceal the body
of a total stranger, their uncle lay in dreamless sleep a few
hundred yards deeper in the wood.</p>

<p>He was awakened by the jolly note of a bugle from
the neighbouring high road, where a <i>char-√†-banc</i> was
bowling by with some belated tourists. The sound cheered
his old heart, it directed his steps into the bargain, and
soon he was on the highway, looking east and west from
under his vizor, and doubtfully revolving what he ought
to do. A deliberate sound of wheels arose in the distance,
and then a cart was seen approaching, well filled with
parcels, driven by a good-natured looking man on a double
bench, and displaying on a board the legend, &ldquo;I. Chandler,
carrier.&rdquo; In the infamously prosaic mind of Mr. Finsbury,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250"></a>250</span>
certain streaks of poetry survived and were still efficient;
they had carried him to Asia Minor as a giddy youth
of forty, and now, in the first hours of his recovered
freedom, they suggested to him the idea of continuing his
flight in Mr. Chandler&rsquo;s cart. It would be cheap; properly
broached, it might even cost nothing, and, after years of
mittens and hygienic flannel, his heart leaped out to meet
the notion of exposure.</p>

<p>Mr. Chandler was perhaps a little puzzled to find so
old a gentleman, so strangely clothed, and begging for a
lift on so retired a roadside. But he was a good-natured
man, glad to do a service, and so he took the stranger
up; and he had his own idea of civility, and so he asked
no questions. Silence, in fact, was quite good enough
for Mr. Chandler; but the cart had scarcely begun to
move forward ere he found himself involved in a one-sided
conversation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see,&rdquo; began Mr. Finsbury, &ldquo;by the mixture
of parcels and boxes that are contained in your cart, each
marked with its individual label, and by the good Flemish
mare you drive, that you occupy the post of carrier in that
great English system of transport which, with all its defects,
is the pride of our country.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; returned Mr. Chandler vaguely, for he
hardly knew what to reply; &ldquo;them parcels posts has
done us carriers a world of harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not a prejudiced man,&rdquo; continued Joseph
Finsbury. &ldquo;As a young man I travelled much. Nothing
was too small or too obscure for me to acquire. At sea
I studied seamanship, learned the complicated knots
employed by mariners, and acquired the technical terms.
At Naples, I would learn the art of making macaroni;
at Nice, the principles of making candied fruit. I never
went to the opera without first buying the book of the
piece, and making myself acquainted with the principal
airs by picking them out on the piano with one finger.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must have seen a deal, sir,&rdquo; remarked the carrier,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251"></a>251</span>
touching up his horse; &ldquo;I wish I could have had your
advantages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know how often the word whip occurs in the
Old Testament?&rdquo; continued the old gentleman. &ldquo;One
hundred and (if I remember exactly) forty-seven times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do it indeed, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Chandler. &ldquo;I never
should have thought it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Bible contains three million five hundred and
one thousand two hundred and forty-nine letters. Of
verses I believe there are upward of eighteen thousand.
There have been many editions of the Bible; Wiclif was
the first to introduce it into England about the year 1300.
The &lsquo;Paragraph Bible,&rsquo; as it is called, is a well-known
edition, and is so called because it is divided into paragraphs.
The &lsquo;Breeches Bible&rsquo; is another well-known
instance, and gets its name either because it was printed
by one Breeches, or because the place of publication bore
that name.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The carrier remarked drily that he thought that was
only natural, and turned his attention to the more congenial
task of passing a cart of hay; it was a matter of
some difficulty, for the road was narrow, and there was
a ditch on either hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; began Mr. Finsbury, when they had
successfully passed the cart, &ldquo;that you hold your reins
with one hand; you should employ two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; cried the carrier contemptuously.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; continued Mr. Finsbury.
&ldquo;What I tell you is a scientific fact, and reposes on the
theory of the lever, a branch of mechanics. There are
some very interesting little shilling books upon the field
of study, which I should think a man in your station
would take a pleasure to read. But I am afraid you
have not cultivated the art of observation; at least we
have now driven together for some time, and I cannot
remember that you have contributed a single fact. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page252"></a>252</span>
is a very false principle, my good man. For instance,
I do not know if you observed that (as you passed the
hay-cart man) you took your left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I did,&rdquo; cried the carrier, who was now
getting belligerent; &ldquo;he&rsquo;d have the law on me if I hadn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In France, now,&rdquo; resumed the old man, &ldquo;and also,
I believe, in the United States of America, you would
have taken the right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would not,&rdquo; cried Mr. Chandler indignantly. &ldquo;I
would have taken the left.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I observe again,&rdquo; continued Mr. Finsbury, scorning
to reply, &ldquo;that you mend the dilapidated parts of your
harness with string. I have always protested against
this carelessness and slovenliness of the English poor.
In an essay that I once read before an appreciative
audience&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t string,&rdquo; said the carrier sullenly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s pack-thread.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have always protested,&rdquo; resumed the old man,
&ldquo;that in their private and domestic life, as well as in
their labouring career, the lower classes of this country
are improvident, thriftless, and extravagant. A stitch
in time&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who the devil <i>are</i> the lower classes?&rdquo; cried the
carrier. &ldquo;You are the lower classes yourself! If I
thought you were a blooming aristocrat, I shouldn&rsquo;t have
given you a lift.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words were uttered with undisguised ill-feeling;
it was plain the pair were not congenial, and further conversation,
even to one of Mr. Finsbury&rsquo;s pathetic loquacity,
was out of the question. With an angry gesture, he
pulled down the brim of the forage-cap over his eyes, and,
producing a note-book and a blue pencil from one of his
innermost pockets, soon became absorbed in calculations.</p>

<p>On his part the carrier fell to whistling with fresh zest;
and if (now and again) he glanced at the companion of his
drive, it was with mingled feelings of triumph and alarm&mdash;triumph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253"></a>253</span>
because he had succeeded in arresting that prodigy
of speech, and alarm lest (by any accident) it should begin
again. Even the shower, which presently overtook and
passed them, was endured by both in silence; and it was
still in silence that they drove at length into Southampton.</p>

<p>Dusk had fallen; the shop windows glimmered forth
into the streets of the old seaport; in private houses lights
were kindled for the evening meal; and Mr. Finsbury
began to think complacently of his night&rsquo;s lodging. He
put his papers by, cleared his throat, and looked doubtfully
at Mr. Chandler.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you be civil enough,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to recommend
me to an inn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Chandler pondered for a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I wonder how about the
&rsquo;Tregonwell Arms.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The &lsquo;Tregonwell Arms&rsquo; will do very well,&rdquo; returned
the old man, &ldquo;if it&rsquo;s clean and cheap, and the people
civil.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking so much of you,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Chandler thoughtfully. &ldquo;I was thinking of my friend
Watts as keeps the &rsquo;ouse; he&rsquo;s a friend of mine, you
see, and he helped me through my trouble last year.
And I was thinking, would it be fair-like on Watts to
saddle him with an old party like you, who might be
the death of him with general information. Would it
be fair to the &rsquo;ouse?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Chandler, with an
air of candid appeal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mark me,&rdquo; cried the old gentleman with spirit.
&ldquo;It was kind in you to bring me here for nothing, but
it gives you no right to address me in such terms. Here&rsquo;s
a shilling for your trouble; and, if you do not choose to
set me down at the &lsquo;Tregonwell Arms,&rsquo; I can find it for
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Chandler was surprised and a little startled; muttering
something apologetic, he returned the shilling, drove
in silence through several intricate lanes and small streets,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254"></a>254</span>
drew up at length before the bright windows of an inn,
and called loudly for Mr. Watts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that you, Jem?&rdquo; cried a hearty voice from the
stableyard. &ldquo;Come in and warm yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only stopped here,&rdquo; Mr. Chandler explained, &ldquo;to
let down an old gent that wants food and lodging. Mind,
I warn you agin him; he&rsquo;s worse nor a temperance
lecturer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Finsbury dismounted with difficulty, for he was
cramped with his long drive, and the shaking he had
received in the accident. The friendly Mr. Watts, in
spite of the carter&rsquo;s scarcely agreeable introduction, treated
the old gentleman with the utmost courtesy, and led him
into the back parlour, where there was a big fire burning in
the grate. Presently a table was spread in the same room,
and he was invited to seat himself before a stewed fowl&mdash;somewhat
the worse for having seen service before&mdash;and
a big pewter mug of ale from the tap.</p>

<p>He rose from supper a giant refreshed; and, changing
his seat to one nearer the fire, began to examine the
other guests with an eye to the delights of oratory. There
were near a dozen present, all men, and (as Joseph exulted
to perceive) all working men. Often already had he seen
cause to bless that appetite for disconnected fact and
rotatory argument which is so marked a character of the
mechanic. But even an audience of working men has to
be courted, and there was no man more deeply versed
in the necessary arts than Joseph Finsbury. He placed
his glasses on his nose, drew from his pocket a bundle of
papers, and spread them before him on a table. He
crumpled them, he smoothed them out; now he skimmed
them over, apparently well pleased with their contents;
now, with tapping pencil and contracted brows, he seemed
maturely to consider some particular statement. A
stealthy glance about the room assured him of the success
of his man&oelig;uvres; all eyes were turned on the performer,
mouths were open, pipes hung suspended; the birds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"></a>255</span>
were charmed. At the same moment the entrance of
Mr. Watts afforded him an opportunity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I observe,&rdquo; said he, addressing the landlord, but
taking at the same time the whole room into his confidence
with an encouraging look, &ldquo;I observe that some of
these gentlemen are looking with curiosity in my direction;
and certainly it is unusual to see anyone immersed in
literary and scientific labours in the public apartment of
an inn. I have here some calculations I made this morning
upon the cost of living in this and other countries&mdash;a
subject, I need scarcely say, highly interesting to the
working classes. I have calculated a scale of living for
incomes of eighty, one hundred and sixty, two hundred, and
two hundred and forty pounds a year. I must confess that
the income of eighty pounds has somewhat baffled me, and
the others are not so exact as I could wish; for the price of
washing varies largely in foreign countries, and the different
cokes, coals, and firewoods fluctuate surprisingly. I
will read my researches, and I hope you won&rsquo;t scruple
to point out to me any little errors that I may have committed
either from oversight or ignorance. I will begin,
gentlemen, with the income of eighty pounds a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Whereupon the old gentleman, with less compassion
than he would have had for brute beasts, delivered himself
of all his tedious calculations. As he occasionally
gave nine versions of a single income, placing the imaginary
person in London, Paris, Bagdad, Spitzbergen, Bassorah,
Heligoland, the Scilly Islands, Brighton, Cincinnati, and
Nijni-Novgorod, with an appropriate outfit for each locality,
it is no wonder that his hearers look back on that evening
as the most tiresome they ever spent.</p>

<p>Long before Mr. Finsbury had reached Nijni-Novgorod
with the income of one hundred and sixty pounds, the
company had dwindled and faded away to a few old topers
and the bored but affable Watts. There was a constant
stream of customers from the outer world, but so soon
as they were served they drank their liquor quickly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page256"></a>256</span>
departed with the utmost celerity for the next public-house.</p>

<p>By the time the young man with two hundred a year
was vegetating in the Scilly Islands, Mr. Watts was left
alone with the economist; and that imaginary person
had scarce commenced life at Brighton before the last
of his pursuers desisted from the chase.</p>

<p>Mr. Finsbury slept soundly after the manifold fatigues
of the day. He rose late, and, after a good breakfast,
ordered the bill. Then it was that he made a discovery
which has been made by many others, both before and
since: that it is one thing to order your bill, and another
to discharge it. The items were moderate and (what
does not always follow) the total small; but, after the
most sedulous review of all his pockets, one and nine
pence halfpenny appeared to be the total of the old gentleman&rsquo;s
available assets. He asked to see Mr. Watts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here is a bill on London for eight hundred pounds,&rdquo;
said Mr. Finsbury, as that worthy appeared. &ldquo;I am
afraid, unless you choose to discount it yourself, it may
detain me a day or two till I can get it cashed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Watts looked at the bill, turned it over, and dogs-eared
it with his fingers. &ldquo;It will keep you a day or two?&rdquo;
he said, repeating the old man&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;You have no
other money with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some trifling change,&rdquo; responded Joseph. &ldquo;Nothing
to speak of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you can send it me; I should be pleased to
trust you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To tell the truth,&rdquo; answered the old gentleman,
&ldquo;I am more than half inclined to stay; I am in need of
funds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a loan of ten shillings would help you, it is at
your service,&rdquo; responded Watts, with eagerness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I think I would rather stay,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;and get my bill discounted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not stay in my house,&rdquo; cried Mr. Watts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"></a>257</span>
&ldquo;This is the last time you shall have a bed at the &lsquo;Tregonwell
Arms.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I insist upon remaining,&rdquo; replied Mr. Finsbury, with
spirit; &ldquo;I remain by Act of Parliament; turn me out
if you dare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then pay your bill,&rdquo; said Mr. Watts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take that,&rdquo; cried the old man, tossing him the
negotiable bill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not legal tender,&rdquo; replied Mr. Watts. &ldquo;You
must leave my house at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot appreciate the contempt I feel for you,
Mr. Watts,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, resigning himself
to circumstances. &ldquo;But you shall feel it in one way:
I refuse to pay my bill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for your bill,&rdquo; responded Mr. Watts.
&ldquo;What I want is your absence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That you shall have!&rdquo; said the old gentleman, and,
taking up his forage-cap as he spoke, he crammed it on his
head. &ldquo;Perhaps you are too insolent,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to
inform me of the time of the next London train?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It leaves in three-quarters of an hour,&rdquo; returned the
innkeeper with alacrity. &ldquo;You can easily catch it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph&rsquo;s position was one of considerable weakness.
On the one hand, it would have been well to avoid the
direct line of railway, since it was there he might expect
his nephews to lie in wait for his recapture; on the other,
it was highly desirable, it was even strictly needful, to get
the bill discounted ere it should be stopped. To London,
therefore, he decided to proceed on the first train; and
there remained but one point to be considered, how to
pay his fare.</p>

<p>Joseph&rsquo;s nails were never clean; he ate almost entirely
with his knife. I doubt if you could say he had the manners
of a gentleman; but he had better than that, a touch of
genuine dignity. Was it from his stay in Asia Minor?
Was it from a strain in the Finsbury blood sometimes
alluded to by customers? At least, when he presented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page258"></a>258</span>
himself before the station-master, his salaam was truly
Oriental, palm-trees appeared to crowd about the little
office, and the simoom or the bulbul&mdash;but I leave this
image to persons better acquainted with the East. His
appearance, besides, was highly in his favour; the uniform
of Sir Faraday, however inconvenient and conspicuous, was,
at least, a costume in which no swindler could have hoped
to prosper; and the exhibition of a valuable watch and a
bill for eight hundred pounds completed what deportment
had begun. A quarter of an hour later, when the train
came up, Mr. Finsbury was introduced to the guard and
installed in a first-class compartment, the station-master
smilingly assuming all responsibility.</p>

<p>As the old gentleman sat waiting the moment of departure,
he was the witness of an incident strangely connected
with the fortunes of his house. A packing-case of cyclopean
bulk was borne along the platform by some dozen
of tottering porters, and ultimately, to the delight of a
considerable crowd, hoisted on board the van. It is often
the cheering task of the historian to direct attention to the
designs and (if it may be reverently said) the artifices of
Providence. In the luggage van, as Joseph was borne out
of the station of Southampton East upon his way to London,
the egg of his romance lay (so to speak) unhatched. The
huge packing-case was directed to lie at Waterloo till called
for, and addressed to one &ldquo;William Dent Pitman&ldquo;; and
the very next article, a goodly barrel jammed into the
corner of the van, bore the superscription, &ldquo;M. Finsbury,
16 John Street, Bloomsbury. Carriage paid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this juxtaposition, the train of powder was prepared;
and there was now wanting only an idle hand
to fire it off.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>

<h5>THE MAGISTRATE IN THE LUGGAGE VAN</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> city of Winchester is famed for a cathedral, a bishop&mdash;but
he was unfortunately killed some years ago while
riding&mdash;a public school, a considerable assortment of the
military, and the deliberate passage of the trains of the
London and South-Western line. These and many similar
associations would have doubtless crowded on the mind
of Joseph Finsbury; but his spirit had at that time flitted
from the railway compartment to a heaven of populous
lecture-halls and endless oratory. His body, in the meanwhile,
lay doubled on the cushions, the forage-cap rakishly
tilted back after the fashion of those that lie in wait for
nursery-maids, the poor old face quiescent, one arm clutching
to his heart <i>Lloyd&rsquo;s Weekly Newspaper</i>.</p>

<p>To him, thus unconscious, enter and exeunt again a
pair of voyagers. These two had saved the train and
no more. A tandem urged to its last speed, an act of
something closely bordering on brigandage at the ticket
office, and a spasm of running, had brought them on the
platform just as the engine uttered its departing snort.
There was but one carriage easily within their reach; and
they had sprung into it, and the leader and elder already
had his feet upon the floor, when he observed Mr. Finsbury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Uncle Joseph! This&rsquo;ll
never do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he backed out, almost upsetting his companion,
and once more closed the door upon the sleeping patriarch.</p>

<p>The next moment the pair had jumped into the baggage
van.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page260"></a>260</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the row about your Uncle Joseph?&rdquo; inquired
the younger traveller, mopping his brow. &ldquo;Does
he object to smoking?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that there&rsquo;s anything the row with
him,&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s by no means the first
comer, my Uncle Joseph, I can tell you! Very respectable
old gentleman; interested in leather; been to Asia
Minor; no family, no assets&mdash;and a tongue, my dear
Wickham, sharper than a serpent&rsquo;s tooth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cantankerous old party, eh?&rdquo; suggested Wickham.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;only a man with
a solid talent for being a bore; rather cheery I dare say, on
a desert island, but on a railway journey insupportable.
You should hear him on Tonti, the ass that started tontines.
He&rsquo;s incredible on Tonti.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; cried Wickham, &ldquo;then you&rsquo;re one of
these Finsbury tontine fellows. I hadn&rsquo;t a guess of that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;do you know that old boy
in the carriage is worth a hundred thousand pounds to
me? There he was asleep, and nobody there but you!
But I spared him, because I&rsquo;m a Conservative in
politics.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wickham, pleased to be in a luggage van, was
flitting to and fro like a gentlemanly butterfly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jingo!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s something for you!
&rsquo;M. Finsbury, 16 John Street, Bloomsbury, London.&rsquo;
M. stands for Michael, you sly dog; you keep two establishments,
do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s Morris,&rdquo; responded Michael from the other
end of the van, where he had found a comfortable seat
upon some sacks. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a little cousin of mine. I like
him myself, because he&rsquo;s afraid of me. He&rsquo;s one of the
ornaments of Bloomsbury, and has a collection of some
kind&mdash;birds&rsquo; eggs or something that&rsquo;s supposed to be
curious. I bet it&rsquo;s nothing to my clients!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a lark it would be to play billy with the labels!&rdquo;
chuckled Mr. Wickham. &ldquo;By George, here&rsquo;s a tack-hammer!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261"></a>261</span>
We might send all these things skipping
about the premises like what&rsquo;s-his-name!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, the guard, surprised by the sound
of voices, opened the door of his little cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had best step in here, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he,
when he had heard their story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come, Wickham?&rdquo; asked Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Catch me&mdash;I want to travel in a van,&rdquo; replied the
youth.</p>

<p>And so the door of communication was closed; and
for the rest of the run Mr. Wickham was left alone over
his diversions on the one side, and on the other Michael
and the guard were closeted together in familiar talk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can get you a compartment here, sir,&rdquo; observed
the official, as the train began to slacken speed before
Bishopstoke station. &ldquo;You had best get out at my door,
and I can bring your friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Wickham, whom we left (as the reader has shrewdly
suspected) beginning to &ldquo;play billy&rdquo; with the labels in
the van, was a young gentleman of much wealth, a pleasing
but sandy exterior, and a highly vacant mind. Not many
months before, he had contrived to get himself blackmailed
by the family of a Wallachian Hospodar, resident for
political reasons in the gay city of Paris. A common
friend (to whom he had confided his distress) recommended
him to Michael; and the lawyer was no sooner in possession
of the facts than he instantly assumed the offensive, fell
on the flank of the Wallachian forces, and, in the inside of
three days, had the satisfaction to behold them routed
and fleeing for the Danube. It is no business of ours
to follow them on this retreat, over which the police were
so obliging as to preside paternally. Thus relieved from
what he loved to refer to as the Bulgarian Atrocity, Mr.
Wickham returned to London with the most unbounded
and embarrassing gratitude and admiration for his saviour.
These sentiments were not repaid either in kind or degree;
indeed, Michael was a trifle ashamed of his new client&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262"></a>262</span>
friendship; it had taken many invitations to get him to
Winchester and Wickham Manor; but he had gone at last,
and was now returning. It has been remarked by some
judicious thinker (possibly J.F. Smith) that Providence
despises to employ no instrument, however humble; and
it is now plain to the dullest that both Mr. Wickham
and the Wallachian Hospodar were liquid lead and wedges
in the hand of Destiny.</p>

<p>Smitten with the desire to shine in Michael&rsquo;s eyes and
show himself a person of original humour and resources,
the young gentleman (who was a magistrate, more by
token, in his native county) was no sooner alone in the
van than he fell upon the labels with all the zeal of a
reformer; and, when he rejoined the lawyer at Bishopstoke,
his face was flushed with his exertions, and his
cigar, which he had suffered to go out was almost bitten
in two.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By George, but this has been a lark!&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent the wrong thing to everybody in England.
These cousins of yours have a packing-case as big as a
house. I&rsquo;ve muddled the whole business up to that extent,
Finsbury, that if it were to get out it&rsquo;s my belief
we should get lynched.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was useless to be serious with Mr. Wickham. &ldquo;Take
care,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;I am getting tired of your perpetual
scrapes; my reputation is beginning to suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your reputation will be all gone before you finish
with me,&rdquo; replied his companion with a grin. &ldquo;Clap it
in the bill, my boy. &lsquo;For total loss of reputation, six and
eightpence.&rsquo; But,&rdquo; continued Mr. Wickham with more
seriousness, &ldquo;could I be bowled out of the Commission
for this little jest? I know it&rsquo;s small, but I like to be
a J.P. Speaking as a professional man, do you think
there&rsquo;s any risk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does it matter?&rdquo; responded Michael, &ldquo;they&rsquo;ll
chuck you out sooner or later. Somehow you don&rsquo;t give
the effect of being a good magistrate.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"></a>263</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I only wish I was a solicitor,&rdquo; retorted his companion,
&ldquo;instead of a poor devil of a country gentleman.
Suppose we start one of those tontine affairs ourselves;
I to pay five hundred a year, and you to guarantee me
against every misfortune except illness or marriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It strikes me,&rdquo; remarked the lawyer with a meditative
laugh, as he lighted a cigar, &ldquo;it strikes me that you must
be a cursed nuisance in this world of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think so, Finsbury?&rdquo; responded the
magistrate, leaning back in his cushions, delighted with
the compliment. &ldquo;Yes, I suppose I am a nuisance. But,
mind you, I have a stake in the country: don&rsquo;t forget
that, dear boy.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>

<h5>MR. GIDEON FORSYTH AND THE GIGANTIC BOX</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">It</span> has been mentioned that at Bournemouth Julia sometimes
made acquaintances; it is true she had but a glimpse
of them before the doors of John Street closed again upon
its captives, but the glimpse was sometimes exhilarating,
and the consequent regret was tempered with hope. Among
those whom she had thus met a year before was a young
barrister of the name of Gideon Forsyth.</p>

<p>About three o&rsquo;clock of the eventful day when the
magistrate tampered with the labels, a somewhat moody
and distempered ramble had carried Mr. Forsyth to the
corner of John Street; and about the same moment
Miss Hazeltine was called to the door of No. 16 by a
thundering double knock.</p>

<p>Mr. Gideon Forsyth was a happy enough young man;
he would have been happier if he had had more money
and less uncle. One hundred and twenty pounds a year
was all his store; but his uncle, Mr. Edward Hugh Bloomfield,
supplemented this with a handsome allowance and a
great deal of advice, couched in language that would
probably have been judged intemperate on board a pirate
ship. Mr. Bloomfield was indeed a figure quite peculiar
to the days of Mr. Gladstone; what we may call (for the
lack of an accepted expression) a Squirradical. Having
acquired years without experience, he carried into the
Radical side of politics those noisy, after-dinner-table
passions, which we are more accustomed to connect with
Toryism in its severe and senile aspects. To the opinions
of Mr. Bradlaugh, in fact, he added the temper and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"></a>265</span>
sympathies of that extinct animal, the Squire; he admired
pugilism, he carried a formidable oaken staff, he was a
reverent churchman, and it was hard to know which would
have more volcanically stirred his choler&mdash;a person who
should have defended the established church, or one
who should have neglected to attend its celebrations.
He had besides some levelling catchwords, justly dreaded
in the family circle; and when he could not go so far as
to declare a step un-English, he might still (and with hardly
less effect) denounce it as unpractical. It was under the
ban of this lesser excommunication that Gideon had fallen.
His views on the study of law had been pronounced unpractical;
and it had been intimated to him, in a vociferous
interview punctuated with the oaken staff, that he must
either take a new start and get a brief or two, or prepare
to live on his own money.</p>

<p>No wonder if Gideon was moody. He had not the
slightest wish to modify his present habits; but he would
not stand on that, since the recall of Mr. Bloomfield&rsquo;s
allowance would revolutionise them still more radically.
He had not the least desire to acquaint himself with law;
he had looked into it already, and it seemed not to repay
attention; but upon this also he was ready to give way.
In fact, he would go as far as he could to meet the views
of his uncle, the Squirradical. But there was one part of
the programme that appeared independent of his will.
How to get a brief? there was the question. And there
was another and a worse. Suppose he got one, should
he prove the better man?</p>

<p>Suddenly he found his way barred by a crowd. A
garishly illuminated van was backed against the kerb;
from its open stern, half resting on the street, half supported
by some glistening athletes, the end of the largest
packing-case in the county of Middlesex might have been
seen protruding; while, on the steps of the house, the
burly person of the driver and the slim figure of a young
girl stood as upon a stage, disputing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"></a>266</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not for us,&rdquo; the girl was saying. &ldquo;I beg you
to take it away; it couldn&rsquo;t get into the house, even if
you managed to get it out of the van.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall leave it on the pavement, then, and M. Finsbury
can arrange with the Vestry as he likes,&rdquo; said the
vanman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am not M. Finsbury,&rdquo; expostulated the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter who you are,&rdquo; said the vanman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must allow me to help you, Miss Hazeltine,&rdquo;
said Gideon, putting out his hand.</p>

<p>Julia gave a little cry of pleasure. &ldquo;O, Mr. Forsyth,&rdquo;
she cried, &ldquo;I am so glad to see you; we must get this
horrid thing, which can only have come here by mistake,
into the house. The man says we&rsquo;ll have to take off the
door, or knock two of our windows into one, or be fined by
the Vestry or Custom House or something for leaving our
parcels on the pavement.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The men by this time had successfully removed the
box from the van, had plumped it down on the pavement,
and now stood leaning against it, or gazing at the
door of No. 16, in visible physical distress and mental
embarrassment. The windows of the whole street had
filled, as if by magic, with interested and entertained
spectators.</p>

<p>With as thoughtful and scientific an expression as he
could assume, Gideon measured the doorway with his
cane, while Julia entered his observations in a drawing-book.
He then measured the box, and, upon comparing
his data, found that there was just enough space for it
to enter. Next throwing off his coat and waistcoat, he
assisted the men to take the door from its hinges. And
lastly, all bystanders being pressed into the service, the
packing-case mounted the steps upon some fifteen pairs
of wavering legs&mdash;scraped, loudly grinding, through the
doorway&mdash;and was deposited at length, with a formidable
convulsion, in the far end of the lobby, which it almost
blocked. The artisans of this victory smiled upon each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"></a>267</span>
other as the dust subsided. It was true they had smashed
a bust of Apollo and ploughed the wall into deep ruts;
but, at least, they were no longer one of the public spectacles
of London.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the vanman, &ldquo;I never see such a
job.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon eloquently expressed his concurrence in this
sentiment by pressing a couple of sovereigns in the man&rsquo;s
hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it three, sir, and I&rsquo;ll stand Sam to everybody
here!&rdquo; cried the latter, and this having been done, the
whole body of volunteer porters swarmed into the van,
which drove off in the direction of the nearest reliable
public-house. Gideon closed the door on their departure,
and turned to Julia; their eyes met; the most uncontrollable
mirth seized upon them both, and they made
the house ring with their laughter. Then curiosity awoke
in Julia&rsquo;s mind, and she went and examined the box,
and more especially the label.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the strangest thing that ever happened,&rdquo;
she said, with another burst of laughter. &ldquo;It is certainly
Morris&rsquo;s handwriting, and I had a letter from him only
this morning, telling me to expect a barrel. Is there a
barrel coming too, do you think, Mr. Forsyth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Statuary with Care, Fragile,&rsquo;&rdquo; read Gideon aloud
from the painted warning on the box. &ldquo;Then you were
told nothing about this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Julia. &ldquo;O, Mr. Forsyth, don&rsquo;t
you think we might take a peep at it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; cited Gideon. &ldquo;Just let me have a
hammer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come down, and I&rsquo;ll show you where it is,&rdquo; cried
Julia. &ldquo;The shelf is too high for me to reach&ldquo;; and,
opening the door of the kitchen stair, she bade Gideon
follow her. They found both the hammer and a chisel;
but Gideon was surprised to see no sign of a servant.
He also discovered that Miss Hazeltine had a very pretty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268"></a>268</span>
little foot and ankle; and the discovery embarrassed
him so much that he was glad to fall at once upon the
packing-case.</p>

<p>He worked hard and earnestly, and dealt his blows
with the precision of a blacksmith; Julia the while standing
silently by his side, and regarding rather the workman
than the work. He was a handsome fellow; she
told herself she had never seen such beautiful arms. And
suddenly, as though he had overheard these thoughts,
Gideon turned and smiled to her. She, too, smiled and
coloured; and the double change became her so prettily
that Gideon forgot to turn away his eyes, and, swinging
the hammer with a will, discharged a smashing blow on
his own knuckles. With admirable presence of mind he
crushed down an oath and substituted the harmless comment,
&ldquo;Butter fingers!&rdquo; But the pain was sharp, his
nerve was shaken, and after an abortive trial he found he
must desist from further operations.</p>

<p>In a moment Julia was off to the pantry; in a moment
she was back again with a basin of water and a sponge,
and had begun to bathe his wounded hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am dreadfully sorry!&rdquo; said Gideon apologetically.
&ldquo;If I had had any manners I should have opened the box
first and smashed my hand afterward. It feels much
better,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I assure you it does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I think you are well enough to direct operations,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;Tell me what to do, and I&rsquo;ll be your
workman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A very pretty workman,&rdquo; said Gideon, rather forgetting
himself. She turned and looked at him, with a
suspicion of a frown; and the indiscreet young man was
glad to direct her attention to the packing-case. The
bulk of the work had been accomplished; and presently
Julia had burst through the last barrier and disclosed a
zone of straw. In a moment they were kneeling side
by side, engaged like hay-makers; the next they were
rewarded with a glimpse of something white and polished;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page269"></a>269</span>
and the next again laid bare an unmistakable marble
leg.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is surely a very athletic person,&rdquo; said Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw anything like it,&rdquo; responded Gideon.
&ldquo;His muscles stand out like penny rolls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another leg was soon disclosed, and then what seemed
to be a third. This resolved itself, however, into a knotted
club resting upon a pedestal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a Hercules,&rdquo; cried Gideon; &ldquo;I might have
guessed that from his calf. I&rsquo;m supposed to be rather
partial to statuary, but when it comes to Hercules, the
police should interfere. I should say,&rdquo; he added, glancing
with disaffection at the swollen leg, &ldquo;that this was about
the biggest and the worst in Europe. What in heaven&rsquo;s
name can have induced him to come here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose nobody else would have a gift of him,&rdquo;
said Julia. &ldquo;And for that matter, I think we could have
done without the monster very well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; returned Gideon. &ldquo;This has
been one of the most amusing experiences of my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;ll forget it very soon,&rdquo; said Julia.
&ldquo;Your hand will remind you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must be going,&rdquo; said Gideon reluctantly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; pleaded Julia. &ldquo;Why should you? Stay and
have tea with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I thought you really wished me to stay,&rdquo; said
Gideon, looking at his hat, &ldquo;of course I should only be
too delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a silly person you must take me for!&rdquo; returned
the girl. &ldquo;Why, of course I do; and, besides, I
want some cakes for tea, and I&rsquo;ve nobody to send. Here
is the latch-key.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon put on his hat with alacrity, and casting one
look at Miss Hazeltine, and another at the legs of Hercules,
threw open the door and departed on his errand.</p>

<p>He returned with a large bag of the choicest and most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page270"></a>270</span>
tempting of cakes and tartlets, and found Julia in the
act of spreading a small tea-table in the lobby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The rooms are all in such a state,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;that
I thought we should be more cosy and comfortable in
our own lobby, and under our own vine and statuary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ever so much better,&rdquo; cried Gideon delightedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O what adorable cream tarts!&rdquo; said Julia, opening
the bag, &ldquo;and the dearest little cherry tartlets, with
all the cherries spilled out into the cream!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Gideon, concealing his dismay, &ldquo;I knew
they would mix beautifully; the woman behind the
counter told me so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Julia, as they began their little festival,
&ldquo;I am going to show you Morris&rsquo;s letter; read it aloud,
please; perhaps there&rsquo;s something I have missed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon took the letter, and spreading it out on his
knee, read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Dear Julia</span>,&mdash;I write you from Browndean, where we are
stopping over for a few days. Uncle was much shaken in that
dreadful accident, of which, I dare say, you have seen the account.
To-morrow I leave him here with John, and come up alone; but
before that, you will have received a barrel <i>containing specimens for
a friend</i>. Do not open it on any account, but leave it in the lobby
till I come.</p>

<p style="text-align: right; padding-right: 5em;">&ldquo;Yours in haste,</p>
<p class="sc rt">&ldquo;M. Finsbury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;Be sure and leave the barrel in the lobby.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;there seems to be nothing about
the monument,&rdquo; and he nodded, as he spoke, at the marble
legs. &ldquo;Miss Hazeltine,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;would you mind
me asking a few questions?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; replied Julia; &ldquo;and if you can make
me understand why Morris has sent a statue of Hercules
instead of a barrel containing specimens for a friend,
I shall be grateful till my dying day. And what are
specimens for a friend?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t a guess,&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;Specimens are
usually bits of stone, but rather smaller than our friend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page271"></a>271</span>
the monument. Still, that is not the point. Are you
quite alone in this big house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am at present,&rdquo; returned Julia. &ldquo;I came
up before them to prepare the house, and get another
servant. But I couldn&rsquo;t get one I liked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you are utterly alone,&rdquo; said Gideon in amazement.
&ldquo;Are you not afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; responded Julia stoutly. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why
I should be more afraid than you would be; I am weaker,
of course, but when I found I must sleep alone in the
house I bought a revolver wonderfully cheap, and made
the man show me how to use it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how do you use it?&rdquo; demanded Gideon, much
amused at her courage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said she, with a smile, &ldquo;you pull the little
trigger thing on top, and then pointing it very low, for it
springs up as you fire, you pull the underneath little trigger
thing, and it goes off as well as if a man had done it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how often have you used it?&rdquo; asked Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I have not used it yet,&rdquo; said the determined
young lady; &ldquo;but I know how, and that makes me
wonderfully courageous, especially when I barricade my
door with a chest of drawers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m awfully glad they are coming back soon,&rdquo; said
Gideon. &ldquo;This business strikes me as excessively unsafe;
if it goes on much longer, I could provide you with a maiden
aunt of mine, or my landlady if you preferred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lend me an aunt!&rdquo; cried Julia. &ldquo;O, what generosity!
I begin to think it must have been you that sent
the Hercules.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Believe me,&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;I admire you
too much to send you such an infamous work of art.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia was beginning to reply, when they were both
startled by a knocking at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Forsyth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, my dear girl,&rdquo; said Gideon, laying
his hand tenderly on her arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page272"></a>272</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s the police,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;They are
coming to complain about the statue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The knock was repeated. It was louder than before,
and more impatient.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Morris,&rdquo; cried Julia, in a startled voice, and she
ran to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>It was indeed Morris that stood before them; not
the Morris of ordinary days, but a wild-looking fellow,
pale and haggard, with bloodshot eyes, and a two-days&rsquo;
beard upon his chin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The barrel!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the barrel that
came this morning?&rdquo; And he stared about the lobby,
his eyes, as they fell upon the legs of Hercules, literally
goggling in his head. &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he screamed.
&ldquo;What is that waxwork? Speak, you fool! What is
that? And where&rsquo;s the barrel&mdash;the water-butt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No barrel came, Morris,&rdquo; responded Julia coldly.
&ldquo;This is the only thing that has arrived.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo; shrieked the miserable man. &ldquo;I never
heard of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It came addressed in your hand,&rdquo; replied Julia;
&ldquo;we had nearly to pull the house down to get it in,
that is all that I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris gazed at her in utter bewilderment. He passed
his hand over his forehead; he leaned against the wall
like a man about to faint. Then his tongue was loosed,
and he overwhelmed the girl with torrents of abuse. Such
fire, such directness, such a choice of ungentlemanly
language, none had ever before suspected Morris to possess;
and the girl trembled and shrank before his fury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not speak to Miss Hazeltine in that way,&rdquo;
said Gideon sternly. &ldquo;It is what I will not suffer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall speak to the girl as I like,&rdquo; returned Morris,
with a fresh outburst of anger. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll speak to the hussy
as she deserves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a word more, sir, not one word,&rdquo; cried Gideon.
&ldquo;Miss Hazeltine,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273"></a>273</span>
girl, &ldquo;you cannot stay a moment longer in the same
house with this unmanly fellow. Here is my arm; let
me take you where you will be secure from insult.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Forsyth,&rdquo; returned Julia, &ldquo;you are right; I
cannot stay here longer, and I am sure I trust myself
to an honourable gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pale and resolute, Gideon offered her his arm, and
the pair descended the steps, followed by Morris clamouring
for the latch-key.</p>

<p>Julia had scarcely handed the key to Morris before
an empty hansom drove smartly into John Street. It
was hailed by both men, and as the cabman drew up his
restive horse, Morris made a dash into the vehicle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sixpence above fare,&rdquo; he cried recklessly. &ldquo;Waterloo
Station for your life. Sixpence for yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make it a shilling, guv&rsquo;ner,&rdquo; said the man, with a
grin; &ldquo;the other parties were first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shilling then,&rdquo; cried Morris, with the inward reflection
that he would reconsider it at Waterloo. The
man whipped up his horse, and the hansom vanished from
John Street.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page274"></a>274</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>

<h5>THE TRIBULATIONS OF MORRIS:
PART THE FIRST</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">As</span> the hansom span through the streets of London, Morris
sought to rally the forces of his mind. The water-butt
with the dead body had miscarried, and it was essential
to recover it. So much was clear; and if, by some blest
good fortune, it was still at the station, all might be well.
If it had been sent out, however, if it were already in the
hands of some wrong person, matters looked more ominous.
People who receive unexplained packages are usually keen
to have them open; the example of Miss Hazeltine (whom
he cursed again) was there to remind him of the circumstance;
and if anyone had opened the water-butt&mdash;&ldquo;O
Lord!&rdquo; cried Morris at the thought, and carried his
hand to his damp forehead. The private conception of
any breach of law is apt to be inspiriting, for the scheme
(while yet inchoate) wears dashing and attractive colours.
Not so in the least that part of the criminal&rsquo;s later reflections
which deal with the police. That useful corps (as
Morris now began to think) had scarce been kept sufficiently
in view when he embarked upon his enterprise.
&ldquo;I must play devilish close,&rdquo; he reflected, and he was
aware of an exquisite thrill of fear in the region of the
spine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Main line or loop?&rdquo; inquired the cabman, through
the scuttle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Main line,&rdquo; replied Morris, and mentally decided that
the man should have his shilling after all. &ldquo;It would
be madness to attract attention,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275"></a>275</span>
what this thing will cost me, first and last, begins to be
a nightmare!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He passed through the booking-office and wandered
disconsolately on the platform. It was a breathing-space
in the day&rsquo;s traffic. There were few people there,
and these for the most part quiescent on the benches.
Morris seemed to attract no remark, which was a good
thing; but, on the other hand, he was making no progress
in his quest. Something must be done, something
must be risked. Every passing instant only added to his
dangers. Summoning all his courage, he stopped a porter,
and asked him if he remembered receiving a barrel by
the morning train. He was anxious to get information,
for the barrel belonged to a friend. &ldquo;It is a matter of
some moment,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;for it contains specimens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was not here this morning, sir,&rdquo; responded the
porter, somewhat reluctantly, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll ask Bill. Do you
recollect, Bill, to have got a barrel from Bournemouth
this morning containing specimens?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about specimens,&rdquo; replied Bill; &ldquo;but
the party as received the barrel I mean raised a sight of
trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Morris, in the agitation of the
moment pressing a penny into the man&rsquo;s hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see, sir, the barrel arrived at one-thirty. No
one claimed it till about three, when a small, sickly-looking
gentleman (probably a curate) came up, and sez he, &lsquo;Have
you got anything for Pitman?&rsquo; or &lsquo;Will&rsquo;m Bent Pitman,&rsquo;
if I recollect right.&rsquo; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t exactly know,&rsquo; sez I, &lsquo;but I
rather fancy that there barrel bears that name.&rsquo; The
little man went up to the barrel, and seemed regularly
all took aback when he saw the address, and then he pitched
into us for not having brought what he wanted. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
care a damn what you want,&rsquo; sez I to him, &lsquo;but if you are
Will&rsquo;m Bent Pitman, there&rsquo;s your barrel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, and did he take it?&rdquo; cried the breathless
Morris.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page276"></a>276</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; returned Bill, &ldquo;it appears it was a packing-case
he was after. The packing-case came; that&rsquo;s sure
enough, because it was about the biggest packing-case
ever I clapped eyes on. And this Pitman he seemed a
good deal cut up, and he had the superintendent out,
and they got hold of the vanman&mdash;him as took the packing-case.
Well, sir,&rdquo; continued Bill, with a smile, &ldquo;I never
see a man in such a state. Everybody about that van
was mortal, bar the horses. Some gen&rsquo;leman (as well as
I could make out) had given the vanman a sov.; and so
that was where the trouble come in, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did he say?&rdquo; gasped Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as he <i>said</i> much, sir,&rdquo; said Bill. &ldquo;But
he offered to fight this Pitman for a pot of beer. He
had lost his book, too, and the receipts, and his men were
all as mortal as himself. O, they were all like&rdquo;&mdash;and
Bill paused for a simile&mdash;&ldquo;like lords! The superintendent
sacked them on the spot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, come, but that&rsquo;s not so bad,&rdquo; said Morris, with
a bursting sigh. &ldquo;He couldn&rsquo;t tell where he took the
packing-case, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; said Bill, &ldquo;nor yet nothink else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what&mdash;what did Pitman do?&rdquo; asked Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, he went off with the barrel in a four-wheeler,
very trembling like,&rdquo; replied Bill. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s
a gentleman as has good health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so the barrel&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; said Morris, half to himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may depend on that, sir,&rdquo; returned the porter.
&ldquo;But you had better see the superintendent.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not in the least; it&rsquo;s of no account,&rdquo; said Morris.
&ldquo;It only contained specimens.&rdquo; And he walked hastily
away.</p>

<p>Ensconced once more in a hansom, he proceeded to
reconsider his position. Suppose (he thought), suppose he
should accept defeat and declare his uncle&rsquo;s death at
once? He should lose the tontine, and with that the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277"></a>277</span>
hope of his seven thousand eight hundred pounds. But
on the other hand, since the shilling to the hansom cabman,
he had begun to see that crime was expensive in
its course, and, since the loss of the water-butt, that it
was uncertain in its consequences. Quietly at first, and
then with growing heat, he reviewed the advantages
of backing out. It involved a loss; but (come to think
of it) no such great loss after all; only that of the tontine,
which had been always a toss-up, which at bottom he
had never really expected. He reminded himself of that
eagerly; he congratulated himself upon his constant
moderation. He had never really expected the tontine;
he had never even very definitely hoped to recover his
seven thousand eight hundred pounds; he had been
hurried into the whole thing by Michael&rsquo;s obvious dishonesty.
Yes, it would probably be better to draw back
from this high-flying venture, settle back on the leather
business&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; cried Morris, bounding in the hansom
like a Jack-in-a-box. &ldquo;I have not only not gained the
tontine&mdash;I have lost the leather business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the monstrous fact. He had no power to
sign; he could not draw a cheque for thirty shillings.
Until he could produce legal evidence of his uncle&rsquo;s death,
he was a penniless outcast&mdash;and as soon as he produced
it he had lost the tontine! There was no hesitation on
the part of Morris; to drop the tontine like a hot chestnut,
to concentrate all his forces on the leather business
and the rest of his small but legitimate inheritance, was
the decision of a single instant. And the next, the full
extent of his calamity was suddenly disclosed to him.
Declare his uncle&rsquo;s death? He couldn&rsquo;t! Since the
body was lost Joseph had (in a legal sense) become immortal.</p>

<p>There was no created vehicle big enough to contain
Morris and his woes. He paid the hansom off and walked
on he knew not whither.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I seem to have gone into this business with too much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278"></a>278</span>
precipitation,&rdquo; he reflected, with a deadly sigh. &ldquo;I fear
it seems too ramified for a person of my powers of mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then a remark of his uncle&rsquo;s flashed into his
memory: If you want to think clearly, put it all down
on paper. &ldquo;Well, the old boy knew a thing or two,&rdquo;
said Morris. &ldquo;I will try; but I don&rsquo;t believe the paper
was ever made that will clear my mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He entered a place of public entertainment, ordered
bread and cheese, and writing materials, and sat down
before them heavily. He tried the pen. It was an excellent
pen, but what was he to write? &ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; cried
Morris. &ldquo;Robinson Crusoe and the double columns!&rdquo;
He prepared his paper after that classic model, and
began as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table class="nobctr f90" width="100%" summary="Contents">

<tr> <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Bad.</i></td>
     <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Good.</i></td></tr>

<tr> <td class="tc3">1. I have lost my uncle&rsquo;s body.</td>
     <td class="tc3">1. But then Pitman has found it.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;I am letting the spirit
of antithesis run away with me. Let&rsquo;s start again.&rdquo;</p>

<table class="nobctr f90" width="100%" summary="Contents">

<tr> <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Bad.</i></td>
     <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Good.</i></td></tr>

     <td class="tc3">1. But then I no longer require to bury it.</td></tr>

     <td class="tc3">2. But I may still save that if
         Pitman disposes of the body, and if I can find a
         physician who will stick at nothing.</td></tr>

         and the rest of my uncle&rsquo;s succession.</td>
     <td class="tc3">3. But not if Pitman gives the body up to the police.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&ldquo;O, but in that case I go to gaol; I had forgot that,&rdquo;
thought Morris. &ldquo;Indeed, I don&rsquo;t know that I had better
dwell on that hypothesis at all; it&rsquo;s all very well to talk
of facing the worst; but in a case of this kind a man&rsquo;s
first duty is to his own nerve. Is there any answer to No. 3?
Is there any possible good side to such a beastly bungle?
There must be, of course, or where would be the use of
this double-entry business? And&mdash;by George, I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279"></a>279</span>
it!&rdquo; he exclaimed; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s exactly the same as the last!&rdquo;
And he hastily re-wrote the passage:</p>

<table class="nobctr f90" width="100%" summary="Contents">

<tr> <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Bad.</i></td>
     <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Good.</i></td></tr>

         uncle&rsquo;s succession.</td>
     <td class="tc3">3. But not if I can find a physician who will stick at nothing.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>&ldquo;This venal doctor seems quite a desideratum,&rdquo; he
reflected. &ldquo;I want him first to give me a certificate that
my uncle is dead, so that I may get the leather business;
and then that he&rsquo;s alive&mdash;but here we are again at the
incompatible interests!&rdquo; And he returned to his tabulation:</p>

<table class="nobctr f90" width="100%" summary="Contents">

     <td class="tc5b" style="width:50%;"><i>Good.</i></td></tr>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page280"></a>280</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, this seems to be a very one-sided business,&rdquo;
exclaimed Morris. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not so much in this method
as I was led to think.&rdquo; He crumpled the paper up and
threw it down; and then, the next moment, picked it
up again and ran it over. &ldquo;It seems it&rsquo;s on the financial
point that my position is weakest,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Is
there positively no way of raising the wind? In a vast
city like this, and surrounded by all the resources of civilisation,
it seems not to be conceived! Let us have no
more precipitation. Is there nothing I can sell? My
collection of signet&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; But at the thought of scattering
these loved treasures the blood leaped into Morris&rsquo;s cheek.
&ldquo;I would rather die!&rdquo; he exclaimed, and, cramming his
hat upon his head, strode forth into the streets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I <i>must</i> raise funds,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;My uncle being
dead, the money in the bank is mine, or would be mine
but for the cursed injustice that has pursued me ever
since I was an orphan in a commercial academy. I know
what any other man would do; any other man in Christendom
would forge; although I don&rsquo;t know why I call it
forging, either, when Joseph&rsquo;s dead, and the funds are
my own. When I think of that, when I think that my
uncle is really as dead as mutton, and that I can&rsquo;t prove
it, my gorge rises at the injustice of the whole affair. I
used to feel bitterly about that seven thousand eight
hundred pounds; it seems a trifle now! Dear me, why,
the day before yesterday I was comparatively happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Morris stood on the sidewalk and heaved another
sobbing sigh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then there&rsquo;s another thing,&rdquo; he resumed; &ldquo;can I?
Am I able? Why didn&rsquo;t I practise different handwritings
while I was young? How a fellow regrets those lost
opportunities when he grows up! But there&rsquo;s one comfort:
it&rsquo;s not morally wrong; I can try it on with a clear
conscience, and even if I was found out, I wouldn&rsquo;t greatly
care&mdash;morally, I mean. And then, if I succeed, and if
Pitman is staunch&mdash;there&rsquo;s nothing to do but find a venal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281"></a>281</span>
doctor; and that ought to be simple enough in a place
like London. By all accounts the town&rsquo;s alive with them.
It wouldn&rsquo;t do, of course, to advertise for a corrupt
physician; that would be impolitic. No, I suppose a
fellow has simply to spot along the streets for a red lamp
and herbs in the window, and then you go in and&mdash;and&mdash;and
put it to him plainly; though it seems a delicate step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was near home now, after many devious wanderings,
and turned up John Street. As he thrust his latch-key
in the lock, another mortifying reflection struck him to
the heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not even this house is mine till I can prove him
dead,&rdquo; he snarled, and slammed the door behind him so
that the windows in the attic rattled.</p>

<p>Night had long fallen; long ago the lamps and the
shop-fronts had begun to glitter down the endless streets;
the lobby was pitch-dark; and, as the devil would have it,
Morris barked his shins and sprawled all his length over
the pedestal of Hercules. The pain was sharp; his temper
was already thoroughly undermined; by a last misfortune
his hand closed on the hammer as he fell; and, in a spasm
of childish irritation, he turned and struck at the offending
statue. There was a splintering crash.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O Lord, what have I done next?&rdquo; wailed Morris;
and he groped his way to find a candle. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he reflected,
as he stood with the light in his hand and looked
upon the mutilated leg, from which about a pound of
muscle was detached. &ldquo;Yes, I have destroyed a genuine
antique; I may be in for thousands!&rdquo; And then there
sprung up in his bosom a sort of angry hope. &ldquo;Let me
see,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Julia&rsquo;s got rid of; there&rsquo;s nothing
to connect me with that beast Forsyth; the men were
all drunk, and (what&rsquo;s better) they&rsquo;ve been all discharged.
O, come, I think this is another case of moral courage!
I&rsquo;ll deny all knowledge of the thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment more, and he stood again before the Hercules,
his lips sternly compressed, the coal-axe and the meat-cleaver
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282"></a>282</span>
under his arm. The next, he had fallen upon the
packing-case. This had been already seriously undermined
by the operations of Gideon; a few well-directed
blows, and it already quaked and gaped; yet a few more,
and it fell about Morris in a shower of boards followed by
an avalanche of straw.</p>

<p>And now the leather-merchant could behold the nature
of his task: and at the first sight his spirit quailed. It
was, indeed, no more ambitious a task for De Lesseps,
with all his men and horses, to attack the hills of Panama,
than for a single, slim young gentleman, with no previous
experience of labour in a quarry, to measure himself
against that bloated monster on his pedestal. And yet
the pair were well encountered: on the one side, bulk&mdash;on
the other, genuine heroic fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Down you shall come, you great big ugly brute!&rdquo;
cried Morris aloud, with something of that passion which
swept the Parisian mob against the walls of the Bastille.
&ldquo;Down you shall come, this night. I&rsquo;ll have none of
you in my lobby.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The face, from its indecent expression, had particularly
animated the zeal of our iconoclast; and it was against
the face that he began his operations. The great height
of the demigod&mdash;for he stood a fathom and half in his
stocking-feet&mdash;offered a preliminary obstacle to this
attack. But here, in the first skirmish of the battle,
intellect already began to triumph over matter. By
means of a pair of library steps, the injured householder
gained a posture of advantage; and, with great swipes
of the coal-axe, proceeded to decapitate the brute.</p>

<p>Two hours later, what had been the erect image of a
gigantic coal-porter turned miraculously white, was now
no more than a medley of disjected members; the quadragenarian
torso prone against the pedestal; the lascivious
countenance leering down the kitchen stair; the legs,
the arms, the hands, and even the fingers, scattered broadcast
on the lobby floor. Half an hour more, and all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page283"></a>283</span>
d√©bris had been laboriously carted to the kitchen; and
Morris, with a gentle sentiment of triumph, looked round
upon the scene of his achievements. Yes, he could deny
all knowledge of it now: the lobby, beyond the fact that
it was partly ruinous, betrayed no trace of the passage of
Hercules. But it was a weary Morris that crept up to
bed; his arms and shoulders ached, the palms of his hands
burned from the rough kisses of the coal-axe, and there
was one smarting finger that stole continually to his mouth.
Sleep long delayed to visit the dilapidated hero, and with
the first peep of day it had again deserted him.</p>

<p>The morning, as though to accord with his disastrous
fortunes, dawned inclemently. An easterly gale was
shouting in the streets; flaws of rain angrily assailed
the windows; and as Morris dressed, the draught from the
fireplace vividly played about his legs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he could not help observing bitterly, &ldquo;that
with all I have to bear, they might have given me decent
weather.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no bread in the house, for Miss Hazeltine
(like all women left to themselves) had subsisted entirely
upon cake. But some of this was found, and (along with
what the poets call a glass of fair, cold water) made up a
semblance of a morning meal, and then down he sat undauntedly
to his delicate task.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more interesting than the study of
signatures, written (as they are) before meals and after,
during indigestion and intoxication; written when the
signer is trembling for the life of his child or has come from
winning the Derby, in his lawyer&rsquo;s office, or under the
bright eyes of his sweetheart. To the vulgar, these seem
never the same; but to the expert, the bank clerk, or the
lithographer, they are constant quantities, and as recognisable
as the North Star to the night-watch on deck.</p>

<p>To all this Morris was alive. In the theory of that
graceful art in which he was now embarking, our spirited
leather-merchant was beyond all reproach. But, happily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page284"></a>284</span>
for the investor, forgery is an affair of practice. And as
Morris sat surrounded by examples of his uncle&rsquo;s signature
and of his own incompetence, insidious depression stole
upon his spirits. From time to time the wind wuthered
in the chimney at his back; from time to time there
swept over Bloomsbury a squall so dark that he must rise
and light the gas; about him was the chill and the mean
disorder of a house out of commission&mdash;the floor bare,
the sofa heaped with books and accounts enveloped in a
dirty table-cloth, the pens rusted, the paper glazed with
a thick film of dust; and yet these were but adminicles of
misery, and the true root of his depression lay round
him on the table in the shape of misbegotten forgeries.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the strangest things I ever heard of,&rdquo; he
complained. &ldquo;It almost seems as if it was a talent that
I didn&rsquo;t possess.&rdquo; He went once more minutely through
his proofs. &ldquo;A clerk would simply gibe at them,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s nothing else but tracing possible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He waited till a squall had passed and there came a blink
of scowling daylight. Then he went to the window, and
in the face of all John Street traced his uncle&rsquo;s signature.
It was a poor thing at the best. &ldquo;But it must do,&rdquo; said
he, as he stood gazing woefully on his handiwork. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
dead, anyway.&rdquo; And he filled up the cheque for a couple
of hundred and sallied forth for the Anglo-Patagonian
Bank.</p>

<p>There, at the desk at which he was accustomed to
transact business, and with as much indifference as he
could assume, Morris presented the forged cheque to the
big, red-bearded Scots teller. The teller seemed to view
it with surprise; and as he turned it this way and that,
and even scrutinised the signature with a magnifying-glass,
his surprise appeared to warm into disfavour. Begging
to be excused for a moment, he passed away into the rearmost
quarters of the bank; whence, after an appreciable
interval, he returned again in earnest talk with a superior,
an oldish and a baldish, but a very gentlemanly man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page285"></a>285</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morris Finsbury, I believe,&rdquo; said the gentlemanly
man, fixing Morris with a pair of double eye-glasses.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is my name,&rdquo; said Morris, quavering. &ldquo;Is
there anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is, Mr. Finsbury, you see we are rather
surprised at receiving this,&rdquo; said the other, flicking at the
cheque. &ldquo;There are no effects.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No effects?&rdquo; cried Morris. &ldquo;Why, I know myself
there must be eight-and-twenty hundred pounds, if there&rsquo;s
a penny.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two seven six four, I think,&rdquo; replied the gentlemanly
man; &ldquo;but it was drawn yesterday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drawn!&rdquo; cried Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By your uncle himself, sir,&rdquo; continued the other.
&ldquo;Not only that, but we discounted a bill for him for&mdash;let
me see&mdash;how much was it for, Mr. Bell?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight hundred, Mr. Judkin,&rdquo; replied the teller.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dent Pitman!&rdquo; cried Morris, staggering back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Judkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s only an expletive,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope there&rsquo;s nothing wrong, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; said
Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All I can tell you,&rdquo; said Morris, with a harsh laugh,
&ldquo;is that the whole thing&rsquo;s impossible. My uncle is at
Bournemouth, unable to move.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried Mr. Bell, and he recovered the cheque
from Mr. Judkin. &ldquo;But this cheque is dated in London,
and to-day,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye account for that,
sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that was a mistake,&rdquo; said Morris, and a deep tide
of colour dyed his face and neck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt, no doubt,&rdquo; said Mr. Judkin, but he looked
at his customer inquiringly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo; resumed Morris, &ldquo;even if there were
no effects&mdash;this is a very trifling sum to overdraw&mdash;our
firm&mdash;the name of Finsbury, is surely good enough for such
a wretched sum as this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page286"></a>286</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;No doubt, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; returned Mr. Judkin;
&ldquo;and if you insist I will take it into consideration; but
I hardly think&mdash;in short, Mr. Finsbury, if there had been
nothing else, the signature seems hardly all that we could
wish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s of no consequence,&rdquo; replied Morris nervously.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get my uncle to sign another. The fact is,&rdquo; he
went on, with a bold stroke, &ldquo;my uncle is so far from well
at present that he was unable to sign this cheque without
assistance, and I fear that my holding the pen for him
may have made the difference in the signature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Judkin shot a keen glance into Morris&rsquo;s face; and
then turned and looked at Mr. Bell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it seems as if we had been victimised
by a swindler. Pray tell Mr. Finsbury we shall put
detectives on at once. As for this cheque of yours, I
regret that, owing to the way it was signed, the bank
can hardly consider it&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;business-like,&rdquo;
and he returned the cheque across the counter.</p>

<p>Morris took it up mechanically; he was thinking of
something very different.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a case of this kind,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I believe the
loss falls on us; I mean upon my uncle and myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does not, sir,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bell; &ldquo;the bank is
responsible, and the bank will either recover the money
or refund it, you may depend on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris&rsquo;s face fell; then it was visited by another
gleam of hope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you leave this entirely in
my hands. I&rsquo;ll sift the matter. I&rsquo;ve an idea, at any rate;
and detectives,&rdquo; he added appealingly, &ldquo;are so expensive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The bank would not hear of it,&rdquo; returned Mr. Judkin.
&ldquo;The bank stands to lose between three and four thousand
pounds; it will spend as much more if necessary. An
undiscovered forger is a permanent danger. We shall
clear it up to the bottom, Mr. Finsbury; set your mind at
rest on that.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287"></a>287</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll stand the loss,&rdquo; said Morris boldly. &ldquo;I
order you to abandon the search.&rdquo; He was determined
that no inquiry should be made.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; returned Mr. Judkin, &ldquo;but we
have nothing to do with you in this matter, which is one
between your uncle and ourselves. If he should take
this opinion, and will either come here himself or let me
see him in his sick-room&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite impossible,&rdquo; cried Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, you see,&rdquo; said Mr. Judkin, &ldquo;how my
hands are tied. The whole affair must go at once into
the hands of the police.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris mechanically folded the cheque and restored
it to his pocket-book.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; said he, and scrambled somehow
out of the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what they suspect,&rdquo; he reflected; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t make them out, their whole behaviour is thoroughly
unbusiness-like. But it doesn&rsquo;t matter; all&rsquo;s up with
everything. The money has been paid; the police are
on the scent; in two hours that idiot Pitman will be
nabbed&mdash;and the whole story of the dead body in the
evening papers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he could have heard what passed in the bank after
his departure he would have been less alarmed, perhaps
more mortified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a curious affair, Mr. Bell,&rdquo; said Mr.
Judkin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Mr. Bell, &ldquo;but I think we have given
him a fright.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, we shall hear no more of Mr. Morris Finsbury,&rdquo;
returned the other; &ldquo;it was a first attempt, and the house
have dealt with us so long that I was anxious to deal
gently. But I suppose, Mr. Bell, there can be no
mistake about yesterday? It was old Mr. Finsbury
himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There could be no possible doubt of that,&rdquo; said Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page288"></a>288</span>
Bell with a chuckle. &ldquo;He explained to me the principles
of banking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said Mr. Judkin. &ldquo;The next time he
calls ask him to step into my room. It is only proper he
should be warned.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH WILLIAM DENT PITMAN TAKES LEGAL
ADVICE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Norfolk</span> Street, King&rsquo;s Road&mdash;jocularly known among
Mr. Pitman&rsquo;s lodgers as &ldquo;Norfolk Island&rdquo;&mdash;is neither a
long, a handsome, nor a pleasing thoroughfare. Dirty,
undersized maids-of-all-work issue from it in pursuit of
beer, or linger on its sidewalk listening to the voice of
love. The cat&rsquo;s-meat man passes twice a day. An
occasional organ-grinder wanders in and wanders out
again, disgusted. In holiday-time the street is the arena
of the young bloods of the neighbourhood, and the house-holders
have an opportunity of studying the manly art
of self-defence. And yet Norfolk Street has one claim to
be respectable, for it contains not a single shop&mdash;unless
you count the public-house at the corner, which is really
in the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>

<p>The door of No. 7 bore a brass plate inscribed with
the legend &ldquo;W.D. Pitman, Artist.&rdquo; It was not a particularly
clean brass plate, nor was No. 7 itself a particularly
inviting place of residence. And yet it had a
character of its own, such as may well quicken the pulse
of the reader&rsquo;s curiosity. For here was the home of an
artist&mdash;and a distinguished artist too, highly distinguished
by his ill-success&mdash;which had never been made the subject
of an article in the illustrated magazines. No wood-engraver
had ever reproduced &ldquo;a corner in the back
drawing-room&rdquo; or &ldquo;the studio mantelpiece&rdquo; of No. 7;
no young lady author had ever commented on &ldquo;the unaffected
simplicity&rdquo; with which Mr. Pitman received
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290"></a>290</span>
her in the midst of his &ldquo;treasures.&rdquo; It is an omission
I would gladly supply, but our business is only with the
backward parts and &ldquo;abject rear&rdquo; of this √¶sthetic dwelling.</p>

<p>Here was a garden, boasting a dwarf fountain (that
never played) in the centre, a few grimy-looking flowers
in pots, two or three newly-planted trees which the spring
of Chelsea visited without noticeable consequence, and
two or three statues after the antique, representing satyrs
and nymphs in the worst possible style of sculptured art.
On one side the garden was overshadowed by a pair of
crazy studios, usually hired out to the more obscure and
youthful practitioners of British art. Opposite these
another lofty out-building, somewhat more carefully
finished, and boasting of a communication with the house
and a private door on the back lane, enshrined the multifarious
industry of Mr. Pitman. All day, it is true, he
was engaged in the work of education at a seminary for
young ladies; but the evenings at least were his own, and
these he would prolong far into the night, now dashing
off &ldquo;A landscape with waterfall&rdquo; in oil, now a volunteer
bust (&ldquo;in marble,&rdquo; as he would gently but proudly observe)
of some public character, now stooping his chisel to a mere
&ldquo;nymph&rdquo; (&ldquo;for a gas-bracket on a stair, sir &ldquo;), or a life-size
&ldquo;Infant Samuel&rdquo; for a religious nursery. Mr. Pitman
had studied in Paris, and he had studied in Rome, supplied
with funds by a fond parent who went subsequently
bankrupt in consequence of a fall in corsets; and though
he was never thought to have the smallest modicum of
talent, it was at one time supposed that he had learned his
business. Eighteen years of what is called &ldquo;tuition&rdquo; had
relieved him of the dangerous knowledge. His artist
lodgers would sometimes reason with him; they would
point out to him how impossible it was to paint by gas-light,
or to sculpture life-sized nymphs without a model.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; he would reply. &ldquo;No one in Norfolk
Street knows it better; and if I were rich I should certainly
employ the best models in London; but, being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page291"></a>291</span>
poor, I have taught myself to do without them. An
occasional model would only disturb my ideal conception
of the figure, and be a positive impediment in my career.
As for painting by an artificial light,&rdquo; he would continue,
&ldquo;that is simply a knack I have found it necessary to
acquire, my days being engrossed in the work of tuition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the moment when we must present him to our
readers, Pitman was in his studio alone, by the dying
light of the October day. He sat (sure enough with &ldquo;unaffected
simplicity&ldquo;) in a Windsor chair, his low-crowned
black felt hat by his side; a dark, weak, harmless, pathetic
little man, clad in the hue of mourning, his coat longer
than is usual with the laity, his neck enclosed in a collar
without a parting, his neckcloth pale in hue and simply
tied; the whole outward man, except for a pointed beard,
tentatively clerical. There was a thinning on the top of
Pitman&rsquo;s head, there were silver hairs at Pitman&rsquo;s temple.
Poor gentleman, he was no longer young; and years, and
poverty, and humble ambition thwarted, make a cheerless
lot.</p>

<p>In front of him, in the corner by the door, there stood
a portly barrel; and let him turn them where he might,
it was always to the barrel that his eyes and his thoughts
returned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Should I open it? Should I return it? Should I
communicate with Mr. Semitopolis at once?&rdquo; he wondered.
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he concluded finally, &ldquo;nothing without
Mr. Finsbury&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo; And he arose and produced
a shabby leathern desk. It opened without the formality
of unlocking, and displayed the thick cream-coloured
note-paper on which Mr. Pitman was in the habit of
communicating with the proprietors of schools and the
parents of his pupils. He placed the desk on the table
by the window, and taking a saucer of Indian ink from
the chimney-piece, laboriously composed the following
letter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;would it be presuming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292"></a>292</span>
on your kindness if I asked you to pay me a visit here
this evening? It is in no trifling matter that I invoke
your valuable assistance, for need I say more than it concerns
the welfare of Mr. Semitopolis&rsquo;s statue of Hercules?
I write you in great agitation of mind; for I have made all
inquiries, and greatly fear that this work of ancient art
has been mislaid. I labour besides under another perplexity,
not unconnected with the first. Pray excuse the
inelegance of this scrawl, and believe me yours in haste,
William D. Pitman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Armed with this he set forth and rang the bell of No.
233 King&rsquo;s Road, the private residence of Michael Finsbury.
He had met the lawyer at a time of great public excitement
in Chelsea; Michael, who had a sense of humour and a
great deal of careless kindness in his nature, followed the
acquaintance up, and, having come to laugh, remained to
drop into a contemptuous kind of friendship. By this
time, which was four years after the first meeting, Pitman
was the lawyer&rsquo;s dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the elderly housekeeper, who opened the
door in person, &ldquo;Mr. Michael&rsquo;s not in yet. But ye&rsquo;re
looking terribly poorly, Mr. Pitman. Take a glass of
sherry, sir, to cheer ye up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; replied the artist. &ldquo;It
is very good in you, but I scarcely feel in sufficient spirits
for sherry. Just give Mr. Finsbury this note, and ask
him to look round&mdash;to the door in the lane, you will please
tell him; I shall be in the studio all evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he turned again into the street and walked slowly
homeward. A hair-dresser&rsquo;s window caught his attention,
and he stared long and earnestly at the proud, high-born,
waxen lady in evening dress, who circulated in the centre
of the show. The artist woke in him, in spite of his
troubles.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all very well to run down the men who make
these things,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s a something&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a haughty, indefinable something about that figure. It&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293"></a>293</span>
what I tried for in my &lsquo;Empress Eug√©nie,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>And he went home reflecting on the quality. &ldquo;They
don&rsquo;t teach you that direct appeal in Paris,&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s British. Come, I am going to sleep, I must wake
up, I must aim higher&mdash;aim higher,&rdquo; cried the little artist
to himself. All through his tea and afterward, as he was
giving his eldest boy a lesson on the fiddle, his mind dwelt
no longer on his troubles, but he was rapt into the better
land; and no sooner was he at liberty than he hastened with
positive exhilaration to his studio.</p>

<p>Not even the sight of the barrel could entirely cast him
down. He flung himself with rising zest into his work&mdash;a
bust of Mr. Gladstone from a photograph; turned (with
extraordinary success) the difficulty of the back of the head,
for which he had no documents beyond a hazy recollection
of a public meeting; delighted himself by his treatment
of the collar; and was only recalled to the cares of life
by Michael Finsbury&rsquo;s rattle at the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; said Michael, advancing to the
grate, where, knowing his friend&rsquo;s delight in a bright fire,
Mr. Pitman had not spared the fuel. &ldquo;I suppose you have
come to grief somehow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no expression strong enough,&rdquo; said the artist.
&ldquo;Mr. Semitopolis&rsquo;s statue has not turned up, and I am
afraid I shall be answerable for the money; but I think
nothing of that&mdash;what I fear, my dear Mr. Finsbury, what
I fear&mdash;alas that I should have to say it!&mdash;is exposure.
The Hercules was to be smuggled out of Italy; a thing
positively wrong, a thing of which a man of my principles
and in my responsible position should have taken (as I
now see too late) no part whatever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This sounds like very serious work,&rdquo; said the lawyer.
&ldquo;It will require a great deal of drink, Pitman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took the liberty of&mdash;in short, of being prepared for
you,&rdquo; replied the artist, pointing to a kettle, a bottle of
gin, a lemon, and glasses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294"></a>294</span></p>

<p>Michael mixed himself a grog, and offered the artist a
cigar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; said Pitman. &ldquo;I used occasionally
to be rather partial to it, but the smell is so disagreeable
about the clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;I am comfortable
now. Unfold your tale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At some length Pitman set forth his sorrows. He
had gone to-day to Waterloo, expecting to receive the
colossal Hercules, and he had received instead a barrel not
big enough to hold Discobolus; yet the barrel was addressed
in the hand (with which he was perfectly acquainted) of
his Roman correspondent. What was stranger still, a case
had arrived by the same train, large enough and heavy
enough to contain the Hercules; and this case had been
taken to an address now undiscoverable. &ldquo;The vanman
(I regret to say it) had been drinking, and his language
was such as I could never bring myself to repeat. He was
at once discharged by the superintendent of the line, who
behaved most properly throughout, and is to make inquiries
at Southampton. In the meanwhile, what was
I to do? I left my address and brought the barrel home;
but, remembering an old adage, I determined not to open
it except in the presence of my lawyer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; asked Michael. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see any
cause to worry. The Hercules has stuck upon the
road. It will drop in to-morrow or the day after;
and as for the barrel, depend upon it, it&rsquo;s a testimonial
from one of your young ladies, and probably contains
oysters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t speak so loud!&rdquo; cried the little artist. &ldquo;It
would cost me my place if I were heard to speak lightly
of the young ladies; and besides, why oysters from Italy?
and why should they come to me addressed in Signor
Ricardi&rsquo;s hand?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have a look at it,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
roll it forward to the light.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page295"></a>295</span></p>

<p>The two men rolled the barrel from the corner, and
stood it on end before the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s heavy enough to be oysters,&rdquo; remarked Michael
judiciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall we open it at once?&rdquo; inquired the artist, who
had grown decidedly cheerful under the combined effects
of company and gin; and without waiting for a reply, he
began to strip as if for a prize-fight, tossed his clerical
collar in the waste-paper basket, hung his clerical coat
upon a nail, and with a chisel in one hand and a hammer
in the other, struck the first blow of the evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the style, William Dent!&rdquo; cried Michael.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s fire for your money! It may be a romantic
visit from one of the young ladies&mdash;a sort of Cleopatra
business. Have a care and don&rsquo;t stave in Cleopatra&rsquo;s
head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sight of Pitman&rsquo;s alacrity was infectious. The
lawyer could sit still no longer. Tossing his cigar into the
fire, he snatched the instrument from the unwilling hands
of the artist, and fell to himself. Soon the sweat stood
in beads upon his large, fair brow; his stylish trousers
were defaced with iron rust, and the state of his chisel
testified to misdirected energies.</p>

<p>A cask is not an easy thing to open, even when you
set about it in the right way; when you set about it
wrongly, the whole structure must be resolved into its
elements. Such was the course pursued alike by the artist
and the lawyer. Presently the last hoop had been removed&mdash;a
couple of smart blows tumbled the staves upon the
ground&mdash;and what had once been a barrel was no more
than a confused heap of broken and distorted boards.</p>

<p>In the midst of these, a certain dismal something,
swathed in blankets, remained for an instant upright, and
then toppled to one side and heavily collapsed before the
fire. Even as the thing subsided, an eye-glass tingled to
the floor and rolled toward the screaming Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue!&rdquo; said Michael. He dashed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296"></a>296</span>
the house door and locked it; then, with a pale face
and bitten lip, he drew near, pulled aside a corner of the
swathing blanket, and recoiled, shuddering.</p>

<p>There was a long silence in the studio.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now tell me,&rdquo; said Michael, in a low voice: &ldquo;Had
you any hand in it?&rdquo; and he pointed to the body.</p>

<p>The little artist could only utter broken and disjointed
sounds.</p>

<p>Michael poured some gin into a glass. &ldquo;Drink that,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid of me. I&rsquo;m your friend
through thick and thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman put the liquor down untasted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I swear before God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is another mystery
to me. In my worst fears I never dreamed of such a thing.
I would not lay a finger on a sucking infant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all square,&rdquo; said Michael, with a sigh of huge
relief. &ldquo;I believe you, old boy.&rdquo; And he shook the artist
warmly by the hand. &ldquo;I thought for a moment,&rdquo; he
added with rather a ghastly smile, &ldquo;I thought for a moment
you might have made away with Mr. Semitopolis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would make no difference if I had,&rdquo; groaned
Pitman. &ldquo;All is at an end for me. There&rsquo;s the writing
on the wall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To begin with,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get him out of
sight; for to be quite plain with you, Pitman, I don&rsquo;t like
your friend&rsquo;s appearance.&rdquo; And with that the lawyer
shuddered. &ldquo;Where can we put it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might put it in the closet there&mdash;if you could
bear to touch it,&rdquo; answered the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody has to do it, Pitman,&rdquo; returned the lawyer;
&ldquo;and it seems as if it had to be me. You go over to the
table, turn your back, and mix me a grog; that&rsquo;s a fair
division of labour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About ninety seconds later the closet-door was heard
to shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There,&rdquo; observed Michael, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s more home-like.
You can turn now, my pallid Pitman. Is this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page297"></a>297</span>
the grog?&rdquo; he ran on. &ldquo;Heaven forgive you, it&rsquo;s a
lemonade.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, O, Finsbury, what are we to do with it?&rdquo;
wailed the artist, laying a clutching hand upon the lawyer&rsquo;s
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do with it?&rdquo; repeated Michael. &ldquo;Bury it in one
of your flower-beds, and erect one of your own statues for
a monument. I tell you we should look devilish romantic
shovelling out the sod by the moon&rsquo;s pale ray. Here,
put some gin in this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I beg of you, Mr. Finsbury, do not trifle with my
misery,&rdquo; cried Pitman. &ldquo;You see before you a man who
has been all his life&mdash;I do not hesitate to say it&mdash;eminently
respectable. Even in this solemn hour I can lay my hand
upon my heart without a blush. Except on the really
trifling point of the smuggling of the Hercules (and even
of that I now humbly repent), my life has been entirely
fit for publication. I never feared the light,&rdquo; cried the
little man; &ldquo;and now&mdash;now&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cheer up, old boy,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;I assure you
we should count this little contretemps a trifle at the
office; it&rsquo;s the sort of thing that may occur to any one;
and if you&rsquo;re perfectly sure you had no hand in it&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What language am I to find&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I&rsquo;ll do that part of it,&rdquo; interrupted Michael, &ldquo;you
have no experience. But the point is this: If&mdash;or rather
since&mdash;you know nothing of the crime, since the&mdash;the
party in the closet&mdash;is neither your father, nor your
brother, nor your creditor, nor your mother-in-law, nor
what they call an injured husband&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, my dear sir!&rdquo; interjected Pitman, horrified.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Since, in short,&rdquo; continued the lawyer, &ldquo;you had no
possible interest in the crime, we have a perfectly free field
before us and a safe game to play. Indeed the problem is
really entertaining; it is one I have long contemplated in
the light of an A. B. case; here it is at last under my
hand in specie; and I mean to pull you through. Do
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"></a>298</span>
you hear that?&mdash;I mean to pull you through. Let me
see: it&rsquo;s a long time since I have had what I call a genuine
holiday; I&rsquo;ll send an excuse to-morrow to the office.
We had best be lively,&rdquo; he added significantly; &ldquo;for we
must not spoil the market for the other man.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; inquired Pitman. &ldquo;What
other man? The inspector of police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Damn the inspector of police!&rdquo; remarked his companion.
&ldquo;If you won&rsquo;t take the short cut and bury
this in your back garden, we must find some one who will
bury it in his. We must place the affair, in short, in the
hands of some one with fewer scruples and more resources.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A private detective, perhaps?&rdquo; suggested Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are times when you fill me with pity,&rdquo; observed
the lawyer. &ldquo;By the way, Pitman,&rdquo; he added
in another key, &ldquo;I have always regretted that you have
no piano in this den of yours. Even if you don&rsquo;t play
yourself, your friends might like to entertain themselves
with a little music while you were mudding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall get one at once if you like,&rdquo; said Pitman
nervously, anxious to please. &ldquo;I play the fiddle a little
as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know you do,&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;but what&rsquo;s the
fiddle&mdash;above all as you play it? What you want is
polyphonic music. And I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is&mdash;since it&rsquo;s
too late for you to buy a piano I&rsquo;ll give you mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the artist blankly. &ldquo;You will
give me yours? I am sure it&rsquo;s very good in you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll give you mine,&rdquo; continued Michael, &ldquo;for
the inspector of police to play on while his men are digging
up your back garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman stared at him in pained amazement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not insane,&rdquo; Michael went on. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m playful,
but quite coherent. See here, Pitman: follow me
one half minute. I mean to profit by the refreshing fact
that we are really and truly innocent; nothing but the
presence of the&mdash;you know what&mdash;connects us with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299"></a>299</span>
crime; once let us get rid of it, no matter how, and there
is no possible clue to trace us by. Well, I give you my
piano; we&rsquo;ll bring it round this very night. To-morrow
we rip the fittings out, deposit the&mdash;our friend&mdash;inside,
plump the whole on a cart, and carry it to the chambers
of a young gentleman whom I know by sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom do you know by sight?&rdquo; repeated Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what is more to the purpose,&rdquo; continued Michael,
&ldquo;whose chambers I know better than he does himself.
A friend of mine&mdash;I call him my friend for brevity; he
is now, I understand, in Demerara and (most likely) in
gaol&mdash;was the previous occupant. I defended him, and I
got him off too&mdash;all saved but honour; his assets were
nil, but he gave me what he had, poor gentleman, and
along with the rest&mdash;the key of his chambers. It&rsquo;s there
that I propose to leave the piano and, shall we say,
Cleopatra?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems very wild,&rdquo; said Pitman. &ldquo;And what will
become of the poor young gentleman whom you know
by sight?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will do him good,&rdquo; said Michael cheerily. &ldquo;Just
what he wants to steady him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, my dear sir, he might be involved in a charge
of&mdash;a charge of murder,&rdquo; gulped the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll be just where we are,&rdquo; returned the lawyer.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s innocent, you see. What hangs people, my dear
Pitman, is the unfortunate circumstance of guilt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But indeed, indeed,&rdquo; pleaded Pitman, &ldquo;the whole
scheme appears to me so wild. Would it not be safer,
after all, just to send for the police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And make a scandal?&rdquo; inquired Michael. &ldquo;&rsquo;The
Chelsea Mystery; alleged innocence of Pitman&rsquo;? How
would that do at the Seminary?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would imply my discharge,&rdquo; admitted the drawing-master.
&ldquo;I cannot deny that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;I am not going to
embark in such a business and have no fun for my money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"></a>300</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O my dear sir, is that a proper spirit?&rdquo; cried
Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I only said that to cheer you up,&rdquo; said the unabashed
Michael. &ldquo;Nothing like a little judicious levity.
But it&rsquo;s quite needless to discuss. If you mean to follow
my advice, come on, and let us get the piano at once.
If you don&rsquo;t, just drop me the word, and I&rsquo;ll leave you
to deal with the whole thing according to your better
judgment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know perfectly well that I depend on you
entirely,&rdquo; returned Pitman. &ldquo;But O, what a night is
before me with that&mdash;horror in my studio! How am
I to think of it on my pillow?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you know, my piano will be there too,&rdquo; said
Michael. &ldquo;That&rsquo;ll raise the average.&rdquo;</p>

<p>An hour later a cart came up the lane, and the
lawyer&rsquo;s piano&mdash;a momentous Broadwood grand&mdash;was
deposited in Mr. Pitman&rsquo;s studio.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII</h3>

<h5>IN WHICH MICHAEL FINSBURY ENJOYS A HOLIDAY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Punctually</span> at eight o&rsquo;clock next morning the lawyer
rattled (according to previous appointment) on the studio
door. He found the artist sadly altered for the worse&mdash;bleached,
bloodshot, and chalky&mdash;a man upon wires,
the tail of his haggard eye still wandering to the closet.
Nor was the professor of drawing less inclined to wonder
at his friend. Michael was usually attired in the height
of fashion, with a certain mercantile brilliancy best described
perhaps as stylish; nor could anything be said
against him, as a rule, but that he looked a trifle too like
a wedding guest to be quite a gentleman. To-day he
had fallen altogether from these heights. He wore a
flannel shirt of washed-out shepherd&rsquo;s tartan, and a suit of
reddish tweeds, of the colour known to tailors as &ldquo;heather
mixture&ldquo;; his neckcloth was black, and tied loosely in a
sailor&rsquo;s knot; a rusty ulster partly concealed these advantages;
and his feet were shod with rough walking boots.
His hat was an old soft felt, which he removed with a
flourish as he entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here I am, William Dent!&rdquo; he cried, and drawing
from his pocket two little wisps of reddish hair, he held
them to his cheeks like side-whiskers and danced about
the studio with the filmy graces of a ballet-girl.</p>

<p>Pitman laughed sadly. &ldquo;I should never have known
you,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nor were you intended to,&rdquo; returned Michael, replacing
his false whiskers in his pocket. &ldquo;Now we must
overhaul you and your wardrobe, and disguise you up to
the nines.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page302"></a>302</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Disguise!&rdquo; cried the artist. &ldquo;Must I indeed disguise
myself? Has it come to that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear creature,&rdquo; returned his companion, &ldquo;disguise
is the spice of life. What is life, passionately exclaimed
a French philosopher, without the pleasures of
disguise? I don&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s always good taste, and I know
it&rsquo;s unprofessional; but what&rsquo;s the odds, downhearted
drawing-master? It has to be. We have to leave a false
impression on the minds of many persons, and in particular
on the mind of Mr. Gideon Forsyth&mdash;the young
gentleman I know by sight&mdash;if he should have the bad
taste to be at home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he be at home?&rdquo; faltered the artist. &ldquo;That
would be the end of all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t matter a d&mdash;&mdash;,&rdquo; returned Michael airily.
&ldquo;Let me see your clothes, and I&rsquo;ll make a new man of
you in a jiffy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the bedroom, to which he was at once conducted,
Michael examined Pitman&rsquo;s poor and scanty wardrobe
with a humorous eye, picked out a short jacket of black
alpaca, and presently added to that a pair of summer
trousers which somehow took his fancy as incongruous.
Then, with the garments in his hand, he scrutinised the
artist closely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that clerical collar,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Have
you nothing else?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The professor of drawing pondered for a moment, and
then brightened; &ldquo;I have a pair of low-necked shirts,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;that I used to wear in Paris as a student. They
are rather loud.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very thing!&rdquo; ejaculated Michael. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look
perfectly beastly. Here are spats, too,&rdquo; he continued,
drawing forth a pair of those offensive little gaiters. &ldquo;Must
have spats! And now you jump into these, and whistle
a tune at the window for (say) three-quarters of an hour.
After that you can rejoin me on the field of glory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, Michael returned to the studio. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page303"></a>303</span>
the morning of the easterly gale; the wind blew shrilly
among the statues in the garden, and drove the rain upon
the skylight in the studio ceiling; and at about the same
moment of the time when Morris attacked the hundredth
version of his uncle&rsquo;s signature in Bloomsbury, Michael,
in Chelsea, began to rip the wires out of the Broadwood
grand.</p>

<p>Three-quarters of an hour later Pitman was admitted,
to find the closet-door standing open, the closet untenanted,
and the piano discreetly shut.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a remarkably heavy instrument,&rdquo; observed
Michael, and turned to consider his friend&rsquo;s disguise.
&ldquo;You must shave off that beard of yours,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My beard!&rdquo; cried Pitman. &ldquo;I cannot shave my
beard. I cannot tamper with my appearance&mdash;my principals
would object. They hold very strong views as to
the appearance of the professors&mdash;young ladies are considered
so romantic. My beard was regarded as quite a
feature when I went about the place. It was regarded,&rdquo;
said the artist, with rising colour, &ldquo;it was regarded as
unbecoming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can let it grow again,&rdquo; returned Michael, &ldquo;and
then you&rsquo;ll be so precious ugly that they&rsquo;ll raise your
salary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to be ugly,&rdquo; cried the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an ass,&rdquo; said Michael, who hated beards
and was delighted to destroy one. &ldquo;Off with it like
a man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, if you insist,&rdquo; said Pitman; and then he
sighed, fetched some hot water from the kitchen, and
setting a glass upon his easel, first clipped his beard with
scissors and then shaved his chin. He could not conceal
from himself, as he regarded the result, that his last claims
to manhood had been sacrificed, but Michael seemed
delighted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A new man, I declare!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;When I give
you the window-glass spectacles I have in my pocket,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"></a>304</span>
you&rsquo;ll be the beau-id√©al of a French commercial
traveller.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman did not reply, but continued to gaze disconsolately
on his image in the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; asked Michael, &ldquo;what the Governor
of South Carolina said to the Governor of North
Carolina? &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a long time between drinks,&rsquo; observed
that powerful thinker; and if you will put your hand
into the top left-hand pocket of my ulster, I have an
impression you will find a flask of brandy. Thank you,
Pitman,&rdquo; he added, as he filled out a glass for each. &ldquo;Now
you will give me news of this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The artist reached out his hand for the water-jug,
but Michael arrested the movement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not if you went upon your knees!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;This
is the finest liqueur brandy in Great Britain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman put his lips to it, set it down again, and sighed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say you&rsquo;re the poorest companion for
a holiday!&rdquo; cried Michael. &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s all you know of
brandy, you shall have no more of it; and while I finish
the flask, you may as well begin business. Come to think
of it,&rdquo; he broke off, &ldquo;I have made an abominable error:
you should have ordered the cart before you were disguised.
Why, Pitman, what the devil&rsquo;s the use of you?
why couldn&rsquo;t you have reminded me of that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never even knew there was a cart to be ordered,&rdquo;
said the artist. &ldquo;But I can take off the disguise again,&rdquo;
he suggested eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You would find it rather a bother to put on your
beard,&rdquo; observed the lawyer. &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a false step;
the sort of thing that hangs people,&rdquo; he continued, with
eminent cheerfulness, as he sipped his brandy; &ldquo;and it
can&rsquo;t be retraced now. Off to the mews with you, make
all the arrangements; they&rsquo;re to take the piano from
here, cart it to Victoria, and despatch it thence by rail to
Cannon Street, to lie till called for in the name of Fortun√©
du Boisgobey.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page305"></a>305</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that rather an awkward name?&rdquo; pleaded
Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awkward?&rdquo; cried Michael scornfully. &ldquo;It would
hang us both! Brown is both safer and easier to pronounce.
Call it Brown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; said Pitman, &ldquo;for my sake, I wish you
wouldn&rsquo;t talk so much of hanging.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Talking about it&rsquo;s nothing, my boy!&rdquo; returned
Michael. &ldquo;But take your hat and be off, and mind and
pay everything beforehand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Left to himself, the lawyer turned his attention for
some time exclusively to the liqueur brandy, and his
spirits, which had been pretty fair all morning, now prodigiously
rose. He proceeded to adjust his whiskers
finally before the glass. &ldquo;Devilish rich,&rdquo; he remarked,
as he contemplated his reflection. &ldquo;I look like a purser&rsquo;s
mate.&rdquo; And at that moment the window-glass spectacles
(which he had hitherto destined for Pitman) flashed into
his mind; he put them on, and fell in love with the effect.
&ldquo;Just what I required,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I wonder what I
look like now? A humorous novelist, I should think,&rdquo;
and he began to practise divers characters of walk, naming
them to himself as he proceeded. &ldquo;Walk of a humorous
novelist&mdash;but that would require an umbrella. Walk of
a purser&rsquo;s mate. Walk of an Australian colonist revisiting
the scenes of childhood. Walk of Sepoy colonel, ditto,
ditto.&rdquo; And in the midst of the Sepoy colonel (which
was an excellent assumption, although inconsistent with
the style of his make-up), his eye lighted on the piano.
This instrument was made to lock both at the top and at
the keyboard, but the key of the latter had been mislaid.
Michael opened it and ran his fingers over the dumb keys.
&ldquo;Fine instrument&mdash;full, rich tone,&rdquo; he observed, and he
drew in a seat.</p>

<p>When Mr. Pitman returned to the studio, he was
appalled to observe his guide, philosopher, and friend
performing miracles of execution on the silent grand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page306"></a>306</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven help me!&rdquo; thought the little man, &ldquo;I fear
he has been drinking! Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; he said aloud;
and Michael, without rising, turned upon him a countenance
somewhat flushed, encircled with the bush of the red
whiskers, and bestridden by the spectacles. &ldquo;Capriccio
in B-flat on the departure of a friend,&rdquo; said he, continuing
his noiseless evolutions.</p>

<p>Indignation awoke in the mind of Pitman. &ldquo;Those
spectacles were to be mine,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;They are an
essential part of my disguise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to wear them myself,&rdquo; replied Michael;
and he added, with some show of truth, &ldquo;There would
be a devil of a lot of suspicion aroused if we both wore
spectacles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, well,&rdquo; said the assenting Pitman, &ldquo;I rather counted
on them; but of course, if you insist. And at any rate,
here is the cart at the door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>While the men were at work, Michael concealed himself
in the closet among the debris of the barrel and the
wires of the piano; and as soon as the coast was clear
the pair sallied forth by the lane, jumped into a hansom
in the King&rsquo;s Road, and were driven rapidly toward
town. It was still cold and raw and boisterous; the rain
beat strongly in their faces, but Michael refused to have
the glass let down; he had now suddenly donned the
character of cicerone, and pointed out and lucidly commented
on the sights of London, as they drove. &ldquo;My
dear fellow,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t seem to know anything
of your native city. Suppose we visited the Tower?
No? Well, perhaps it&rsquo;s a trifle out of our way. But, anyway&mdash;Here,
cabby, drive round by Trafalgar Square!&rdquo;
And on that historic battle-field he insisted on drawing up,
while he criticised the statues and gave the artist many
curious details (quite new to history) of the lives of the
celebrated men they represented.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to express what Pitman suffered
in the cab: cold, wet, terror in the capital degree, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307"></a>307</span>
grounded distrust of the commander under whom he
served, a sense of imprudency in the matter of the low-necked
shirt, a bitter sense of the decline and fall involved
in the deprivation of his beard, all these were among
the ingredients of the bowl. To reach the restaurant,
for which they were deviously steering, was the first relief.
To hear Michael bespeak a private room was a second and
a still greater. Nor, as they mounted the stair under the
guidance of an unintelligible alien, did he fail to note
with gratitude the fewness of the persons present, or the
still more cheering fact that the greater part of these were
exiles from the land of France. It was thus a blessed
thought that none of them would be connected with the
Seminary; for even the French professor, though admittedly
a Papist, he could scarce imagine frequenting so
rakish an establishment.</p>

<p>The alien introduced them into a small bare room
with a single table, a sofa, and a dwarfish fire; and Michael
called promptly for more coals and a couple of brandies
and sodas.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, no,&rdquo; said Pitman, &ldquo;surely not&mdash;no more to
drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you would be at,&rdquo; said Michael
plaintively. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s positively necessary to do something;
and one shouldn&rsquo;t smoke before meals&mdash;I thought that was
understood. You seem to have no idea of hygiene.&rdquo; And
he compared his watch with the clock upon the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>Pitman fell into bitter musing; here he was, ridiculously
shorn, absurdly disguised, in the company of a
drunken man in spectacles, and waiting for a champagne
luncheon in a restaurant painfully foreign. What would
his principals think, if they could see him? What if they
knew his tragic and deceitful errand?</p>

<p>From these reflections he was aroused by the entrance
of the alien with the brandies and sodas. Michael took
one and bade the waiter pass the other to his friend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page308"></a>308</span></p>

<p>Pitman waved it from him with his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
let me lose all self-respect,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Anything to oblige a friend,&rdquo; returned Michael.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not going to drink alone. Here,&rdquo; he added to
the waiter, &ldquo;you take it.&rdquo; And, then, touching glasses,
&ldquo;The health of Mr. Gideon Forsyth,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Meestare Gidden Borsye,&rdquo; replied the waiter, and
he tossed off the liquor in four gulps.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have another?&rdquo; said Michael, with undisguised
interest. &ldquo;I never saw a man drink faster. It restores
one&rsquo;s confidence in the human race.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the waiter excused himself politely, and, assisted
by some one from without, began to bring in lunch.</p>

<p>Michael made an excellent meal, which he washed
down with a bottle of Heidsieck&rsquo;s dry monopole. As
for the artist, he was far too uneasy to eat, and his companion
flatly refused to let him share in the champagne
unless he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One of us must stay sober,&rdquo; remarked the lawyer,
&ldquo;and I won&rsquo;t give you champagne on the strength of a
leg of grouse. I have to be cautious,&rdquo; he added confidentially.
&ldquo;One drunken man, excellent business&mdash;two
drunken men, all my eye.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the production of coffee and departure of the waiter,
Michael might have been observed to make portentous
efforts after gravity of mien. He looked his friend in the
face (one eye perhaps a trifle off), and addressed him
thickly but severely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Enough of this fooling,&rdquo; was his not inappropriate
exordium. &ldquo;To business. Mark me closely. I am an
Australian. My name is John Dickson, though you
mightn&rsquo;t think it from my unassuming appearance. You
will be relieved to hear that I am rich, sir, very rich. You
can&rsquo;t go into this sort of thing too thoroughly, Pitman;
the whole secret is preparation, and I can get up my biography
from the beginning, and I could tell it you now, only
I have forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309"></a>309</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I&rsquo;m stupid&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; cried Michael. &ldquo;Very stupid; but rich
too&mdash;richer than I am. I thought you would enjoy it,
Pitman, so I&rsquo;ve arranged that you were to be literally
wallowing in wealth. But then, on the other hand, you&rsquo;re
only an American, and a maker of india-rubber overshoes
at that. And the worst of it is&mdash;why should I conceal it
from you?&mdash;the worst of it is that you&rsquo;re called Ezra
Thomas. Now,&rdquo; said Michael, with a really appalling
seriousness of manner, &ldquo;tell me who we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unfortunate little man was cross-examined till he
knew these facts by heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; cried the lawyer. &ldquo;Our plans are laid.
Thoroughly consistent&mdash;that&rsquo;s the great thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; objected Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you&rsquo;ll understand right enough when it comes
to the point,&rdquo; said Michael, rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There doesn&rsquo;t seem any story to it,&rdquo; said the artist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can invent one as we go along,&rdquo; returned the
lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t invent,&rdquo; protested Pitman. &ldquo;I never
could invent in all my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find you&rsquo;ll have to, my boy,&rdquo; was Michael&rsquo;s
easy comment, and he began calling for the waiter, with
whom he at once resumed a sparkling conversation.</p>

<p>It was a downcast little man that followed him. &ldquo;Of
course he is very clever, but can I trust him in such a
state?&rdquo; he asked himself. And when they were once
more in a hansom, he took heart of grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he faltered, &ldquo;it would be wiser,
considering all things, to put this business off?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Put off till to-morrow what can be done to-day?&rdquo;
cried Michael, with indignation. &ldquo;Never heard of such
a thing! Cheer up, it&rsquo;s all right, go in and win&mdash;there&rsquo;s
a lion-hearted Pitman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Cannon Street they inquired for Mr. Brown&rsquo;s piano,
which had duly arrived, drove thence to a neighbouring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310"></a>310</span>
mews, where they contracted for a cart, and while that
was being got ready, took shelter in the harness-room
beside the stove. Here the lawyer presently toppled
against the wall and fell into a gentle slumber; so that
Pitman found himself launched on his own resources in
the midst of several staring loafers, such as love to spend
unprofitable days about a stable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rough day, sir,&rdquo; observed one. &ldquo;Do you go far?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s a&mdash;rather a rough day,&rdquo; said the artist;
and then, feeling that he must change the conversation,
&ldquo;My friend is an Australian; he is very impulsive,&rdquo; he
added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An Australian?&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a brother
myself in Melbourne. Does your friend come from that
way at all?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not exactly,&rdquo; replied the artist, whose ideas of
the geography of New Holland were a little scattered.
&ldquo;He lives immensely far inland, and is very rich.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The loafers gazed with great respect upon the slumbering
colonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; remarked the second speaker, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a mighty
big place, is Australia. Do you come from thereaway
too?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; said Pitman. &ldquo;I do not, and I
don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; he added irritably. And then, feeling
some diversion needful, he fell upon Michael and shook
him up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; said the lawyer, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cart is nearly ready,&rdquo; said Pitman sternly. &ldquo;I
will not allow you to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right&mdash;no offence, old man,&rdquo; replied Michael,
yawning. &ldquo;A little sleep never did anybody any harm;
I feel comparatively sober now. But what&rsquo;s all the
hurry?&rdquo; he added, looking round him glassily. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see the cart, and I&rsquo;ve forgotten where we left the piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What more the lawyer might have said, in the confidence
of the moment, is with Pitman a matter of tremulous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"></a>311</span>
conjecture to this day; but by the most blessed
circumstance the cart was then announced, and Michael
must bend the forces of his mind to the more difficult
task of rising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you&rsquo;ll drive,&rdquo; he remarked to his companion,
as he clambered on the vehicle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drive!&rdquo; cried Pitman. &ldquo;I never did such a thing
in my life. I cannot drive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; responded Michael with entire composure,
&ldquo;neither can I see. But just as you like. Anything
to oblige a friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A glimpse of the ostler&rsquo;s darkening countenance decided
Pitman. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said desperately, &ldquo;you drive.
I&rsquo;ll tell you where to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On Michael in the character of charioteer (since this
is not intended to be a novel of adventure) it would be
superfluous to dwell at length. Pitman, as he sat holding
on and gasping counsels, sole witness of this singular feat,
knew not whether most to admire the driver&rsquo;s valour or
his undeserved good fortune. But the latter at least
prevailed, the cart reached Cannon Street without disaster;
and Mr. Brown&rsquo;s piano was speedily and cleverly got on
board.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the leading porter, smiling as he
mentally reckoned up a handful of loose silver, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s
a mortal heavy piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the richness of the tone,&rdquo; returned Michael, as
he drove away.</p>

<p>It was but a little distance in the rain, which now
fell thick and quiet, to the neighbourhood of Mr. Gideon
Forsyth&rsquo;s chambers in the Temple. There, in a deserted
by-street, Michael drew up the horses and gave them in
charge to a blighted shoe-black; and the pair descending
from the cart, whereon they had figured so incongruously,
set forth on foot for the decisive scene of their adventure.
For the first time Michael displayed a shadow of uneasiness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"></a>312</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Are my whiskers right?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;It would be
the devil and all if I was spotted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They are perfectly in their place,&rdquo; returned Pitman,
with scant attention. &ldquo;But is my disguise equally effective?
There is nothing more likely than that I should
meet some of my patrons.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, nobody could tell you without your beard,&rdquo; said
Michael. &ldquo;All you have to do is to remember to speak
slow; you speak through your nose already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only hope the young man won&rsquo;t be at home,&rdquo; sighed
Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I only hope he&rsquo;ll be alone,&rdquo; returned the lawyer.
&ldquo;It will save a precious sight of man&oelig;uvring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And sure enough, when they had knocked at the door,
Gideon admitted them in person to a room, warmed by
a moderate fire, framed nearly to the roof in works connected
with the bench of British Themis, and offering,
except in one particular, eloquent testimony to the legal
zeal of the proprietor. The one particular was the
chimney-piece, which displayed a varied assortment
of pipes, tobacco, cigar-boxes, and yellow-backed French
novels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Forsyth, I believe?&rdquo; It was Michael who thus
opened the engagement. &ldquo;We have come to trouble
you with a piece of business. I fear it&rsquo;s scarcely professional&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I ought to be instructed through a
solicitor,&rdquo; replied Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, you shall name your own, and the whole
affair can be put on a more regular footing to-morrow,&rdquo;
replied Michael, taking a chair and motioning Pitman
to do the same. &ldquo;But you see we didn&rsquo;t know any
solicitors; we did happen to know of you, and time
presses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I inquire, gentlemen,&rdquo; asked Gideon, &ldquo;to
whom it was I am indebted for a recommendation?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may inquire,&rdquo; returned the lawyer, with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page313"></a>313</span>
foolish laugh; &ldquo;but I was invited not to tell you&mdash;till
the thing was done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My uncle, no doubt,&rdquo; was the barrister&rsquo;s conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is John Dickson,&rdquo; continued Michael;
&ldquo;a pretty well-known name in Ballarat; and my friend
here is Mr. Ezra Thomas, of the United States of America,
a wealthy manufacturer of india-rubber overshoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop one moment till I make a note of that,&rdquo; said
Gideon; any one might have supposed he was an old
practitioner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind my smoking a cigar?&rdquo;
asked Michael. He had pulled himself together for the
entrance; now again there began to settle on his mind
clouds of irresponsible humour and incipient slumber;
and he hoped (as so many have hoped in the like case)
that a cigar would clear him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; cried Gideon blandly. &ldquo;Try one of
mine; I can confidently recommend them.&rdquo; And he
handed the box to his client.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In case I don&rsquo;t make myself perfectly clear,&rdquo; observed
the Australian, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s perhaps best to tell you candidly
that I&rsquo;ve been lunching. It&rsquo;s a thing that may happen
to any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, certainly,&rdquo; replied the affable barrister. &ldquo;But
please be under no sense of hurry. I can give you,&rdquo; he
added, thoughtfully consulting his watch&mdash;&ldquo;yes, I can give
you the whole afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The business that brings me here,&rdquo; resumed the
Australian with gusto, &ldquo;is devilish delicate, I can tell
you. My friend Mr. Thomas, being an American of
Portuguese extraction, unacquainted with our habits, and
a wealthy manufacturer of Broadwood pianos&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Broadwood pianos?&rdquo; cried Gideon, with some surprise.
&ldquo;Dear me, do I understand Mr. Thomas to be a
member of the firm?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, pirated Broadwoods,&rdquo; returned Michael. &ldquo;My
friend&rsquo;s the American Broadwood.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"></a>314</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I understood you to say,&rdquo; objected Gideon,
&ldquo;I certainly have it so in my notes&mdash;that your friend
was a manufacturer of india-rubber overshoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it&rsquo;s confusing at first,&rdquo; said the Australian,
with a beaming smile. &ldquo;But he&mdash;in short, he combines
the two professions. And many others besides&mdash;many,
many, many others,&rdquo; repeated Mr. Dickson, with drunken
solemnity. &ldquo;Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s cotton-mills are one of the
sights of Tallahassee; Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s tobacco-mills are
the pride of Richmond, Va.; in short, he&rsquo;s one of my
oldest friends, Mr. Forsyth, and I lay his case before you
with emotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The barrister looked at Mr. Thomas and was agreeably
prepossessed by his open although nervous countenance,
and the simplicity and timidity of his manner.
&ldquo;What a people are these Americans!&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;Look at this nervous, weedy, simple little bird in a
low-necked shirt, and think of him wielding and directing
interests so extended and seemingly incongruous!
But had we not better,&rdquo; he observed aloud, &ldquo;had we
not perhaps better approach the facts?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Man of business, I perceive, sir!&rdquo; said the Australian.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s approach the facts. It&rsquo;s a breach of promise
case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The unhappy artist was so unprepared for this view
of his position that he could scarce suppress a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;they are apt to be very
troublesome. Tell me everything about it,&rdquo; he added
kindly; &ldquo;if you require my assistance, conceal nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> tell him,&rdquo; said Michael, feeling, apparently,
that he had done his share. &ldquo;My friend will tell you
all about it,&rdquo; he added to Gideon, with a yawn. &ldquo;Excuse
my closing my eyes a moment; I&rsquo;ve been sitting up with
a sick friend.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman gazed blankly about the room; rage and despair
seethed in his innocent spirit; thoughts of flight, thoughts
even of suicide, came and went before him; and still the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315"></a>315</span>
barrister patiently waited, and still the artist groped in
vain for any form of words, however insignificant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a breach of promise case,&rdquo; he said at last, in
a low voice. &ldquo;I&mdash;I am threatened with a breach of promise
case.&rdquo; Here, in desperate quest of inspiration, he made
a clutch at his beard; his fingers closed upon the unfamiliar
smoothness of a shaven chin; and with that,
hope and courage (if such expressions could ever have
been appropriate in the case of Pitman) conjointly fled.
He shook Michael roughly. &ldquo;Wake up!&rdquo; he cried,
with genuine irritation in his tones. &ldquo;I cannot do it,
and you know I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must excuse my friend,&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
no hand as a narrator of stirring incident. The case
is simple,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;My friend is a man of very
strong passions, and accustomed to a simple, patriarchal
style of life. You see the thing from here: unfortunate
visit to Europe, followed by unfortunate acquaintance
with sham foreign count, who has a lovely daughter.
Mr. Thomas was quite carried away; he proposed, he
was accepted, and he wrote&mdash;wrote in a style which I
am sure he must regret to-day. If these letters are produced
in court, sir, Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s character is gone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said the Australian emphatically, &ldquo;it
isn&rsquo;t possible to understand unless you saw them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a painful circumstance,&rdquo; said Gideon; he
glanced pityingly in the direction of the culprit, and,
observing on his countenance every mark of confusion,
pityingly withdrew his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that would be nothing,&rdquo; continued Mr. Dickson
sternly, &ldquo;but I wish&mdash;I wish from my heart, sir, I could
say that Mr. Thomas&rsquo;s hands were clean. He has no
excuse; for he was engaged at the time&mdash;and is still
engaged&mdash;to the belle of Constantinople, Ga. My friend&rsquo;s
conduct was unworthy of the brutes that perish.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ga.?&rdquo; repeated Gideon inquiringly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316"></a>316</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A contraction in current use,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;Ga.
for Georgia, in the same way as Co. for Company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was aware it was sometimes so written,&rdquo; returned
the barrister, &ldquo;but not that it was so pronounced.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fact, I assure you,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;You now see for
yourself, sir, that if this unhappy person is to be saved,
some devilish sharp practice will be needed. There&rsquo;s
money, and no desire to spare it. Mr. Thomas could
write a cheque to-morrow for a hundred thousand. And,
Mr. Forsyth, there&rsquo;s better than money. The foreign
count&mdash;Count Tarnow, he calls himself&mdash;was formerly a
tobacconist in Bayswater, and passed under the humble
but expressive name of Schmidt; his daughter&mdash;if she
is his daughter&mdash;there&rsquo;s another point&mdash;make a note of
that, Mr. Forsyth&mdash;his daughter at that time actually
served in the shop&mdash;and she now proposes to marry a
man of the eminence of Mr. Thomas! Now do you see
our game? We know they contemplate a move; and
we wish to forestall &rsquo;em. Down you go to Hampton
Court, where they live, and threaten, or bribe, or both,
until you get the letters; if you can&rsquo;t, God help us, we
must go to court and Thomas must be exposed. I&rsquo;ll
be done with him for one,&rdquo; added the unchivalrous
friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There seem some elements of success,&rdquo; said Gideon.
&ldquo;Was Schmidt at all known to the police?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We hope so,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;We have every ground
to think so. Mark the neighbourhood&mdash;Bayswater!
Doesn&rsquo;t Bayswater occur to you as very suggestive?&rdquo;</p>

<p>For perhaps the sixth time during this remarkable
interview, Gideon wondered if he were not becoming
light-headed. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s just because he has been
lunching,&rdquo; he thought; and then added aloud, &ldquo;To what
figure may I go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps five thousand would be enough for to-day,&rdquo;
said Michael. &ldquo;And now, sir, do not let me detain you
any longer; the afternoon wears on; there are plenty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317"></a>317</span>
trains to Hampton Court; and I needn&rsquo;t try to describe
to you the impatience of my friend. Here is a five-pound
note for current expenses; and here is the address.&rdquo;
And Michael began to write, paused, tore up the paper,
and put the pieces in his pocket. &ldquo;I will dictate,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;my writing is so uncertain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon took down the address, &ldquo;Count Tarnow,
Kurnaul Villa, Hampton Court.&rdquo; Then he wrote something
else on a sheet of paper. &ldquo;You said you had not
chosen a solicitor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;For a case of this sort,
here is the best man in London.&rdquo; And he handed the
paper to Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;God bless me!&rdquo; ejaculated Michael, as he read his
own address.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I daresay you have seen his name connected
with some rather painful cases,&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;But he
is himself a perfectly honest man, and his capacity is
recognised. And now, gentlemen, it only remains for me
to ask where I shall communicate with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Langham, of course,&rdquo; returned Michael. &ldquo;Till
to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Till to-night,&rdquo; replied Gideon, smiling. &ldquo;I suppose
I may knock you up at a late hour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Any hour, any hour,&rdquo; cried the vanishing solicitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s a young fellow with a head upon his
shoulders,&rdquo; he said to Pitman, as soon as they were in
the street.</p>

<p>Pitman was indistinctly heard to murmur, &ldquo;Perfect
fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a bit of him,&rdquo; returned Michael. &ldquo;He knows
who&rsquo;s the best solicitor in London, and it&rsquo;s not every
man can say the same. But, I say, didn&rsquo;t I pitch it in
hot?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman returned no answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said the lawyer, pausing, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong
with the long-suffering Pitman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had no right to speak of me as you did,&rdquo; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"></a>318</span>
artist broke out; &ldquo;your language was perfectly unjustifiable;
you have wounded me deeply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never said a word about you,&rdquo; replied Michael.
&ldquo;I spoke of Ezra Thomas; and do please remember
that there&rsquo;s no such party.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just as hard to bear,&rdquo; said the artist.</p>

<p>But by this time they had reached the corner of the
by-street; and there was the faithful shoeblack, standing
by the horses&rsquo; heads with a splendid assumption of
dignity; and there was the piano, figuring forlorn upon
the cart, while the rain beat upon its unprotected sides
and trickled down its elegantly varnished legs.</p>

<p>The shoeblack was again put in requisition to bring
five or six strong fellows from the neighbouring public-house;
and the last battle of the campaign opened. It
is probable that Mr. Gideon Forsyth had not yet taken
his seat in the train for Hampton Court, before Michael
opened the door of the chambers, and the grunting porters
deposited the Broadwood grand in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the lawyer, after he had sent the
men about their business, &ldquo;one more precaution. We
must leave him the key of the piano, and we must contrive
that he shall find it. Let me see.&rdquo; And he built
a square tower of cigars upon the top of the instrument,
and dropped the key into the middle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor young man,&rdquo; said the artist, as they descended
the stairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He is in a devil of a position,&rdquo; assented Michael
drily. &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll brace him up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that reminds me,&rdquo; observed the excellent Pitman,
&ldquo;that I fear I displayed a most ungrateful temper.
I had no right, I see, to resent expressions, wounding as
they were, which were in no sense directed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; cried Michael, getting on the cart.
&ldquo;Not a word more, Pitman. Very proper feeling on
your part; no man of self-respect can stand by and hear
his <i>alias</i> insulted.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page319"></a>319</span></p>

<p>The rain had now ceased, Michael was fairly sober,
the body had been disposed of, and the friends were reconciled.
The return to the mews was therefore (in comparison
with previous stages of the day&rsquo;s adventures)
quite a holiday outing; and when they had returned the
cart and walked forth again from the stable-yard, unchallenged,
and even unsuspected, Pitman drew a deep
breath of joy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we can go home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitman,&rdquo; said the lawyer, stopping short, &ldquo;your
recklessness fills me with concern. What! we have been
wet through the greater part of the day, and you propose,
in cold blood, to go home! No, sir&mdash;hot Scotch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And taking his friend&rsquo;s arm he led him sternly towards
the nearest public-house. Nor was Pitman (I regret to
say) wholly unwilling. Now that peace was restored and
the body gone, a certain innocent skittishness began to
appear in the manners of the artist; and when he touched
his steaming glass to Michael&rsquo;s, he giggled aloud like a
venturesome school-girl at a picnic.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IX</h3>

<h5>GLORIOUS CONCLUSION OF MICHAEL FINSBURY&rsquo;S
HOLIDAY</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">I know</span> Michael Finsbury personally; my business&mdash;I
know the awkwardness of having such a man for a lawyer&mdash;still
it&rsquo;s an old story now, and there is such a thing as
gratitude, and, in short, my legal business, although now
(I am thankful to say) of quite a placid character, remains
entirely in Michael&rsquo;s hands. But the trouble is I have no
natural talent for addresses; I learn one for every man&mdash;that
is friendship&rsquo;s offering; and the friend who subsequently
changes his residence is dead to me, memory
refusing to pursue him. Thus it comes about that, as I
always write to Michael at his office, I cannot swear to his
number in the King&rsquo;s Road. Of course (like my neighbours),
I have been to dinner there. Of late years, since
his accession to wealth, neglect of business, and election to
the club, these little festivals have become common. He
picks up a few fellows in the smoking-room&mdash;all men of Attic
wit&mdash;myself, for instance, if he has the luck to find me
disengaged; a string of hansoms may be observed (by
Her Majesty) bowling gaily through St. James&rsquo;s Park;
and in a quarter of an hour the party surrounds one of
the best appointed boards in London.</p>

<p>But at the time of which we write the house in the
King&rsquo;s Road (let us still continue to call it No. 233) was
kept very quiet; when Michael entertained guests it was
at the halls of Nichol or Verrey that he would convene them,
and the door of his private residence remained closed
against his friends. The upper story, which was sunny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321"></a>321</span>
was set apart for his father; the drawing-room was never
opened; the dining-room was the scene of Michael&rsquo;s life.
It is in this pleasant apartment, sheltered from the curiosity
of King&rsquo;s Road by wire blinds, and entirely surrounded by
the lawyer&rsquo;s unrivalled library of poetry and criminal
trials, that we find him sitting down to his dinner after
his holiday with Pitman. A spare old lady, with very
bright eyes and a mouth humorously compressed, waited
upon the lawyer&rsquo;s needs; in every line of her countenance
she betrayed the fact that she was an old retainer; in
every word that fell from her lips she flaunted the glorious
circumstance of a Scottish origin; and the fear with
which this powerful combination fills the boldest was
obviously no stranger to the bosom of our friend. The
hot Scotch having somewhat warmed up the embers
of the Heidsieck, it was touching to observe the master&rsquo;s
eagerness to pull himself together under the servant&rsquo;s
eye; and when he remarked, &ldquo;I think, Teena, I&rsquo;ll take
a brandy and soda,&rdquo; he spoke like a man doubtful of
his elocution, and not half certain of obedience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No such a thing, Mr. Michael,&rdquo; was the prompt
return. &ldquo;Clar&rsquo;t and water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Teena, I daresay you know best,&rdquo; said
the master. &ldquo;Very fatiguing day at the office, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the retainer, &ldquo;ye never were near the
office!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O yes, I was though; I was repeatedly along Fleet
Street,&rdquo; returned Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty pliskies ye&rsquo;ve been at this day!&rdquo; cried the
old lady, with humorous alacrity; and then, &ldquo;Take care&mdash;don&rsquo;t
break my crystal!&rdquo; she cried, as the lawyer came
within an ace of knocking the glasses off the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And how is he keeping?&rdquo; asked Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, just the same, Mr. Michael, just the way he&rsquo;ll
be till the end, worthy man!&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;But
ye&rsquo;ll not be the first that&rsquo;s asked me that the day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo; said the lawyer. &ldquo;Who else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page322"></a>322</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, that&rsquo;s a joke, too,&rdquo; said Teena grimly. &ldquo;A
friend of yours: Mr. Morris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morris! What was the little beggar wanting here?&rdquo;
inquired Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wantin&rsquo;? To see him,&rdquo; replied the housekeeper,
completing her meaning by a movement of the thumb
toward the upper story. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s by his way of it; but
I&rsquo;ve an idee of my own. He tried to bribe me, Mr. Michael.
Bribe&mdash;me!&rdquo; she repeated, with inimitable scorn. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
no&rsquo; kind of a young gentleman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did he so?&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;I bet he didn&rsquo;t offer
much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more he did,&rdquo; replied Teena; nor could any
subsequent questioning elicit from her the sum with
which the thrifty leather merchant had attempted to
corrupt her. &ldquo;But I sent him about his business,&rdquo; she
said gallantly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not come here again in a hurry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He mustn&rsquo;t see my father, you know; mind that!&rdquo;
said Michael. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to have any public exhibition
to a little beast like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No fear of me lettin&rsquo; him,&rdquo; replied the trusty one.
&ldquo;But the joke is this, Mr. Michael&mdash;see, ye&rsquo;re upsettin&rsquo;
the sauce, that&rsquo;s a clean table-cloth&mdash;the best of the
joke is that he thinks your father&rsquo;s dead and you&rsquo;re
keepin&rsquo; it dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael whistled. &ldquo;Set a thief to catch a thief,&rdquo;
said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Exac&rsquo;ly what I told him!&rdquo; cried the delighted
dame.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make him dance for that,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t ye get the law of him some way?&rdquo; suggested
Teena truculently.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think I could, and I&rsquo;m quite sure I don&rsquo;t
want to,&rdquo; replied Michael. &ldquo;But I say, Teena, I really
don&rsquo;t believe this claret&rsquo;s wholesome; it&rsquo;s not a sound,
reliable wine. Give us a brandy and soda, there&rsquo;s a good
soul.&rdquo; Teena&rsquo;s face became like adamant. &ldquo;Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323"></a>323</span>
then,&rdquo; said the lawyer fretfully, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t eat any more
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye can please yourself about that, Mr. Michael,&rdquo;
said Teena, and began composedly to take away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do wish Teena wasn&rsquo;t a faithful servant!&rdquo; sighed
the lawyer, as he issued into King&rsquo;s Road.</p>

<p>The rain had ceased; the wind still blew, but only
with a pleasant freshness; the town, in the clear darkness
of the night, glittered with street-lamps and shone
with glancing rain-pools. &ldquo;Come, this is better,&rdquo; thought
the lawyer to himself, and he walked on eastward, lending
a pleased ear to the wheels and the million footfalls
of the city.</p>

<p>Near the end of the King&rsquo;s Road he remembered his
brandy and soda, and entered a flaunting public-house.
A good many persons were present, a waterman from a
cab-stand, half a dozen of the chronically unemployed, a
gentleman (in one corner) trying to sell √¶sthetic photographs
out of a leather case to another and very youthful
gentleman with a yellow goatee, and a pair of lovers
debating some fine shade (in the other). But the centrepiece
and great attraction was a little old man, in a black,
ready-made surtout, which was obviously a recent purchase.
On the marble table in front of him, beside a sandwich
and a glass of beer, there lay a battered forage-cap.
His hand fluttered abroad with oratorical gestures; his
voice, naturally shrill, was plainly tuned to the pitch of
the lecture-room; and by arts, comparable to those of the
Ancient Mariner, he was now holding spell-bound the barmaid,
the waterman, and four of the unemployed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have examined all the theatres in London,&rdquo; he
was saying; &ldquo;and pacing the principal entrances, I have
ascertained them to be ridiculously disproportionate to
the requirements of their audiences. The doors opened
the wrong way&mdash;I forget at this moment which it is, but
have a note of it at home; they were frequently locked
during the performance, and when the auditorium was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page324"></a>324</span>
literally thronged with English people. You have probably
not had my opportunities of comparing distant
lands; but I can assure you this has been long ago recognised
as a mark of aristocratic government. Do you
suppose, in a country really self-governed, such abuses
could exist? Your own intelligence, however uncultivated,
tells you they could not. Take Austria, a country even
possibly more enslaved than England. I have myself
conversed with one of the survivors of the Ring Theatre,
and though his colloquial German was not very good, I
succeeded in gathering a pretty clear idea of his opinion
of the case. But, what will perhaps interest you still more,
here is a cutting on the subject from a Vienna newspaper,
which I will now read to you, translating as I go. You
can see for yourselves; it is printed in the German character.&rdquo;
And he held the cutting out for verification, much
as a conjurer passes a trick orange along the front bench.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hullo, old gentleman! Is this you?&rdquo; said Michael,
laying his hand upon the orator&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>The figure turned with a convulsion of alarm, and
showed the countenance of Mr. Joseph Finsbury.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, Michael!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one with you,
is there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Michael, ordering a brandy and soda,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s nobody with me; whom do you expect?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought of Morris or John,&rdquo; said the old gentleman,
evidently greatly relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil would I be doing with Morris or
John?&rdquo; cried the nephew.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; returned Joseph. &ldquo;And
I believe I can trust you. I believe you will stand by me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hardly know what you mean,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
&ldquo;but if you are in need of money I am flush.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that, my dear boy,&rdquo; said the uncle, shaking
him by the hand. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you all about it afterwards.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; responded the nephew. &ldquo;I stand treat,
Uncle Joseph; what will you have?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page325"></a>325</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take
another sandwich. I daresay I surprise you,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;with my presence in a public-house; but the fact
is, I act on a sound but little-known principle of my
own&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s better known than you suppose,&rdquo; said Michael
sipping his brandy and soda. &ldquo;I always act on it myself
when I want a drink.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gentleman, who was anxious to propitiate
Michael, laughed a cheerless laugh. &ldquo;You have such a
flow of spirits,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am sure I often find it quite
amusing. But regarding this principle of which I was
about to speak. It is that of accommodating one&rsquo;s-self to
the manners of any land (however humble) in which our lot
may be cast. Now, in France, for instance, every one goes
to a caf√© for his meals; in America, to what is called a
&rsquo;two-bit house&rsquo;; in England the people resort to such an
institution as the present for refreshment. With sandwiches,
tea, and an occasional glass of bitter beer, a man
can live luxuriously in London for fourteen pounds twelve
shillings per annum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; returned Michael, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s not
including clothes, washing, or boots. The whole thing,
with cigars and occasional sprees, costs me over seven
hundred a year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But this was Michael&rsquo;s last interruption. He listened
in good-humoured silence to the remainder of his uncle&rsquo;s
lecture, which speedily branched to political reform,
thence to the theory of the weather-glass, with an illustrative
account of a bora in the Adriatic; thence again to
the best manner of teaching arithmetic to the deaf-and-dumb;
and with that, the sandwich being then no more,
<i>explicuit valde feliciter</i>. A moment later the pair issued
forth on the King&rsquo;s Road.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; said his uncle, &ldquo;the reason that I am here
is because I cannot endure those nephews of mine. I find
them intolerable.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page326"></a>326</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I daresay you do,&rdquo; assented Michael, &ldquo;I never could
stand them for a moment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t let me speak,&rdquo; continued the old
gentleman bitterly; &ldquo;I never was allowed to get a word
in edgewise; I was shut up at once with some impertinent
remark. They kept me on short allowance of pencils, when
I wished to make notes of the most absorbing interest;
the daily newspaper was guarded from me like a young
baby from a gorilla. Now, you know me, Michael. I live
for my calculations; I live for my manifold and ever-changing
views of life; pens and paper and the productions
of the popular press are to me as important as food and
drink; and my life was growing quite intolerable when,
in the confusion of that fortunate railway accident at
Browndean, I made my escape. They must think me
dead, and are trying to deceive the world for the chance
of the tontine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;By the way, how do you stand for money?&rdquo; asked
Michael kindly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pecuniarily speaking, I am rich,&rdquo; returned the old
man with cheerfulness. &ldquo;I am living at present at the
rate of one hundred a year, with unlimited pens and
paper; the British Museum at which to get books; and
all the newspapers I choose to read. But it&rsquo;s extraordinary
how little a man of intellectual interest requires to
bother with books in a progressive age. The newspapers
supply all the conclusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;come and stay
with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very kind
of you, but you scarcely understand what a peculiar position
I occupy. There are some little financial complications;
as a guardian, my efforts were not altogether
blessed; and not to put too fine a point upon the
matter, I am absolutely in the power of that vile
fellow, Morris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You should be disguised,&rdquo; cried Michael eagerly;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page327"></a>327</span>
&ldquo;I will lend you a pair of window-glass spectacles and
some red side-whiskers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I had already canvassed that idea,&rdquo; replied the old
gentleman, &ldquo;but feared to awaken remark in my unpretentious
lodgings. The aristocracy, I am well aware&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But see here,&rdquo; interrupted Michael, &ldquo;how do you
come to have any money at all? Don&rsquo;t make a stranger of
me, Uncle Joseph; I know all about the trust, and the
hash you made of it, and the assignment you were forced
to make to Morris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joseph narrated his dealings with the bank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, but I say, this won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; cried the lawyer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
put your foot in it. You had no right to do what you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole thing is mine, Michael,&rdquo; protested the old
gentleman. &ldquo;I founded and nursed that business on
principles entirely of my own.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very fine,&rdquo; said the lawyer; &ldquo;but you
made an assignment, you were forced to make it, too;
even then your position was extremely shaky; but now,
my dear sir, it means the dock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; cried Joseph; &ldquo;the law cannot
be so unjust as that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the cream of the thing,&rdquo; interrupted Michael,
with a sudden shout of laughter, &ldquo;the cream of the thing
is this, that of course you&rsquo;ve downed the leather business!
I must say, Uncle Joseph, you have strange ideas of law,
but I like your taste in humour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I see nothing to laugh at,&rdquo; observed Mr. Finsbury
tartly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And talking of that, has Morris any power to sign
for the firm?&rdquo; asked Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one but myself,&rdquo; replied Joseph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor devil of a Morris! O, poor devil of a Morris!&rdquo;
cried the lawyer in delight. &ldquo;And his keeping up the
farce that you&rsquo;re at home! O, Morris, the Lord has
delivered you into my hands! Let me see, Uncle Joseph,
what do you suppose the leather business worth?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page328"></a>328</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It <i>was</i> worth a hundred thousand,&rdquo; said Joseph
bitterly, &ldquo;when it was in my hands. But then there
came a Scotsman&mdash;it is supposed he had a certain talent&mdash;it
was entirely directed to book-keeping&mdash;no accountant
in London could understand a word of any of his books;
and then there was Morris, who is perfectly incompetent.
And now it is worth very little. Morris tried to sell it
last year; and Pogram and Jarris offered only four
thousand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall turn my attention to leather,&rdquo; said Michael
with decision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; asked Joseph. &ldquo;I advise you not. There
is nothing in the whole field of commerce more surprising
than the fluctuations of the leather market. Its sensitiveness
may be described as morbid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Uncle Joseph, what have you done with
all that money?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Paid it into a bank and drew twenty pounds,&rdquo;
answered Mr. Finsbury promptly. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;To-morrow I shall send
down a clerk with a cheque for a hundred, and he&rsquo;ll draw
out the original sum and return it to the Anglo-Patagonian,
with some sort of explanation which I will try to invent
for you. That will clear your feet, and as Morris can&rsquo;t
touch a penny of it without forgery, it will do no harm
to my little scheme.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what am I to do?&rdquo; asked Joseph; &ldquo;I cannot
live upon nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear?&rdquo; returned Michael. &ldquo;I send you
a cheque for a hundred; which leaves you eighty to go
along upon; and when that&rsquo;s done, apply to me again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I would rather not be beholden to your bounty all the
same,&rdquo; said Joseph, biting at his white moustache. &ldquo;I
would rather live on my own money, since I have it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael grasped his arm. &ldquo;Will nothing make you
believe,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I am trying to save you from
Dartmoor?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page329"></a>329</span></p>

<p>His earnestness staggered the old man. &ldquo;I must turn
my attention to law,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it will be a new field; for
though, of course, I understand its general principles, I have
never really applied my mind to the details, and this view of
yours, for example, comes on me entirely by surprise. But
you may be right, and of course at my time of life&mdash;for I
am no longer young&mdash;any really long term of imprisonment
would be highly prejudicial. But, my dear nephew, I have
no claim on you; you have no call to support me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll probably get
it out of the leather business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And having taken down the old gentleman&rsquo;s address,
Michael left him at the corner of a street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a wonderful old muddler!&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;and
what a singular thing is life! I seem to be condemned to be
the instrument of Providence. Let me see; what have I
done to-day? Disposed of a dead body, saved Pitman,
saved my Uncle Joseph, brightened up Forsyth, and
drunk a devil of a lot of most indifferent liquor. Let&rsquo;s
top off with a visit to my cousins, and be the instrument
of Providence in earnest. To-morrow I can turn my
attention to leather; to-night I&rsquo;ll just make it lively for
&rsquo;em in a friendly spirit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About a quarter of an hour later, as the clocks were
striking eleven, the instrument of Providence descended
from a hansom, and, bidding the driver wait, rapped at the
door of No. 16 John Street.</p>

<p>It was promptly opened by Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s you, Michael,&rdquo; he said, carefully blocking up
the narrow opening: &ldquo;it&rsquo;s very late.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael without a word reached forth, grasped Morris
warmly by the hand, and gave it so extreme a squeeze
that the sullen householder fell back. Profiting by this
movement, the lawyer obtained a footing in the lobby and
marched into the dining-room, with Morris at his heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s my Uncle Joseph?&rdquo; demanded Michael,
sitting down in the most comfortable chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"></a>330</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not been very well lately,&rdquo; replied Morris; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
staying at Browndean; John is nursing him; and I am
alone, as you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael smiled to himself. &ldquo;I want to see him on
particular business,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t expect to see my uncle when you won&rsquo;t
let me see your father,&rdquo; returned Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fiddlestick,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;My father is my father;
but Joseph is just as much my uncle as he&rsquo;s yours; and
you have no right to sequestrate his person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do no such thing,&rdquo; said Morris doggedly. &ldquo;He is
not well, he is dangerously ill and nobody can see him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, then,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make a
clean breast of it. I have come down like the opossum,
Morris; I have come to compromise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Poor Morris turned as pale as death, and then a flush
of wrath against the injustice of man&rsquo;s destiny dyed his
very temples. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe a word of it!&rdquo; And when Michael had assured him
of his seriousness, &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; he cried, with another
deep flush, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t; so you can put that in your pipe
and smoke it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; said Michael queerly. &ldquo;You say your uncle
is dangerously ill, and you won&rsquo;t compromise? There&rsquo;s
something very fishy about that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Morris hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I only say it&rsquo;s fishy,&rdquo; returned Michael, &ldquo;that is,
pertaining to the finny tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to insinuate anything?&rdquo; cried Morris
stormily, trying the high hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Insinuate?&rdquo; repeated Michael. &ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s
begin to use awkward expressions! Let us drown our
differences in a bottle, like two affable kinsmen. <i>The Two
Affable Kinsmen</i>, sometimes attributed to Shakespeare,&rdquo;
he added.</p>

<p>Morris&rsquo;s mind was labouring like a mill. &ldquo;Does he
suspect? or is this chance and stuff? Should I soap, or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page331"></a>331</span>
should I bully? Soap,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;It gains time.
Well,&rdquo; said he aloud, and with rather a painful affectation
of heartiness, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s long since we have had an evening
together, Michael; and though my habits (as you know)
are very temperate, I may as well make an exception.
Excuse me one moment till I fetch a bottle of whisky
from the cellar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No whisky for me,&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;a little of the
old still champagne or nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment Morris stood irresolute, for the wine was
very valuable: the next he had quitted the room without
a word. His quick mind had perceived his advantage;
in thus dunning him for the cream of the cellar, Michael
was playing into his hand. &ldquo;One bottle?&rdquo; he thought.
&ldquo;By George, I&rsquo;ll give him two! this is no moment for
economy; and once the beast is drunk, it&rsquo;s strange if I
don&rsquo;t wring his secret out of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With two bottles, accordingly, he returned. Glasses
were produced, and Morris filled them with hospitable
grace.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I drink to you, cousin!&rdquo; he cried gaily. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
spare the wine-cup in my house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael drank his glass deliberately, standing at the
table; filled it again, and returned to his chair, carrying
the bottle along with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The spoils of war!&rdquo; he said apologetically. &ldquo;The
weakest goes to the wall. Science, Morris, science.&rdquo;
Morris could think of no reply, and for an appreciable
interval silence reigned. But two glasses of the still
champagne produced a rapid change in Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a want of vivacity about you, Morris,&rdquo; he
observed. &ldquo;You may be deep; but I&rsquo;ll be hanged if
you&rsquo;re vivacious!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think me deep?&rdquo; asked Morris
with an air of pleased simplicity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you won&rsquo;t compromise,&rdquo; said the lawyer.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re deep dog, Morris, very deep dog, not t&rsquo; compromise&mdash;remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page332"></a>332</span>
deep dog. And a very good glass
of wine; it&rsquo;s the only respectable feature in the Finsbury
family, this wine; rarer thing than a title&mdash;much rarer.
Now a man with glass wine like this in cellar, I wonder why
won&rsquo;t compromise?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, <i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;t compromise before, you know,&rdquo;
said the smiling Morris. &ldquo;Turn about is fair play.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder why <i>I</i> wouldn&rsquo; compromise? I wonder why
<i>you</i> wouldn&rsquo;?&rdquo; inquired Michael. &ldquo;I wonder why we
each think the other wouldn&rsquo;? &rsquo;S quite a remarrable&mdash;remarkable
problem,&rdquo; he added, triumphing over oral
obstacles, not without obvious pride. &ldquo;Wonder what we
each think&mdash;don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you suppose to have been my reason?&rdquo;
asked Morris adroitly.</p>

<p>Michael looked at him and winked. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s cool,&rdquo;
said he. &ldquo;Next thing, you&rsquo;ll ask me to help you out of
the muddle. I know I&rsquo;m emissary of Providence, but
not that kind! You get out of it yourself, like √Üsop and
the other fellow. Must be dreadful muddle for young
orphan o&rsquo; forty; leather business and all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not sure I know myself,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;This is
exc&rsquo;lent vintage, sir&mdash;exc&rsquo;lent vintage. Nothing against
the tipple. Only thing: here&rsquo;s a valuable uncle disappeared.
Now, what I want to know: where&rsquo;s valuable
uncle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have told you: he is at Browndean,&rdquo; answered
Morris, furtively wiping his brow, for these repeated hints
began to tell upon him cruelly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very easy say Brown&mdash;Browndee&mdash;no&rsquo; so easy after
all!&rdquo; cried Michael. &ldquo;Easy say; anything&rsquo;s easy say,
when you can say it. What I don&rsquo; like&rsquo;s total disappearance
of an uncle. Not business-like.&rdquo; And he wagged
his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is all perfectly simple,&rdquo; returned Morris, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page333"></a>333</span>
laborious calm. &ldquo;There is no mystery. He stays at
Browndean, where he got a shake in the accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;got devil of a shake!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; cried Morris sharply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Best possible authority. Told me so yourself,&rdquo; said
the lawyer. &ldquo;But if you tell me contrary now, of course
I&rsquo;m bound to believe either the one story or the other.
Point is&mdash;I&rsquo;ve upset this bottle, still champagne&rsquo;s exc&rsquo;lent
thing carpet&mdash;point is, is valuable uncle dead&mdash;an&rsquo;&mdash;bury?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris sprang from his seat. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say?&rdquo;
he gasped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I say it&rsquo;s exc&rsquo;lent thing carpet,&rdquo; replied Michael,
rising. &ldquo;Exc&rsquo;lent thing promote healthy action of the
skin. Well, it&rsquo;s all one, anyway. Give my love to Uncle
Champagne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going away?&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Awf&rsquo;ly sorry, ole man. Got to sit up sick friend,&rdquo;
said the wavering Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shall not go till you have explained your hints,&rdquo;
returned Morris fiercely. &ldquo;What do you mean? What
brought you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No offence, I trust,&rdquo; said the lawyer, turning round
as he opened the door; &ldquo;only doing my duty as shemishery
of Providence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Groping his way to the front-door, he opened it with
some difficulty, and descended the steps to the hansom.
The tired driver looked up as he approached, and asked
where he was to go next.</p>

<p>Michael observed that Morris had followed him to
the steps; a brilliant inspiration came to him. &ldquo;Anything
t&rsquo; give pain,&rdquo; he reflected.... &ldquo;Drive Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard,&rdquo;
he added aloud, holding to the wheel to steady himself;
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s something devilish fishy, cabby, about those
cousins. Mush&rsquo; be cleared up! Drive Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean that, sir,&rdquo; said the man, with the
ready sympathy of the lower orders for an intoxicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page334"></a>334</span>
gentleman. &ldquo;I had better take you home, sir; you can
go to Scotland Yard to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it as friend or as perfessional man you advise me
not to go Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard t&rsquo;night?&rdquo; inquired Michael.
&ldquo;All righ&rsquo;, never min&rsquo; Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard, drive Gaiety bar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Gaiety bar is closed,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then home,&rdquo; said Michael, with the same cheerfulness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; said Michael, entering
the vehicle, &ldquo;drive Shcotlan&rsquo; Yard and ask.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll have a card,&rdquo; said the man, through the
little aperture in the top, &ldquo;give me your card-case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What imagi&mdash;imagination in a cabby!&rdquo; cried the
lawyer, producing his card-case, and handing it to the
driver.</p>

<p>The man read it by the light of the lamp. &ldquo;Mr.
Michael Finsbury, 233 King&rsquo;s Road, Chelsea. Is that
it, sir?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; cried Michael, &ldquo;drive there if you
can see way.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X</h3>

<h5>GIDEON FORSYTH AND THE BROADWOOD GRAND</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">The</span> reader has perhaps read that remarkable work,
&ldquo;Who Put Back the Clock?&rdquo; by E. H. B., which appeared
for several days upon the railway bookstalls and then
vanished entirely from the face of the earth. Whether
eating Time makes the chief of his diet out of old editions;
whether Providence has passed a special enactment on
behalf of authors; or whether these last have taken the
law into their own hand, bound themselves into a dark
conspiracy with a password, which I would die rather than
reveal, and night after night sally forth under some vigorous
leader, such as Mr. James Payn or Mr. Walter Besant, on
their task of secret spoliation&mdash;certain it is, at least, that
the old editions pass, giving place to new. To the proof,
it is believed there are now only three copies extant of
&ldquo;Who Put Back the Clock?&rdquo; one in the British Museum,
successfully concealed by a wrong entry in the catalogue;
another in one of the cellars (the cellar where the music
accumulates) of the Advocates&rsquo; Library at Edinburgh;
and a third, bound in morocco, in the possession of Gideon
Forsyth. To account for the very different fate attending
this third exemplar, the readiest theory is to suppose that
Gideon admired the tale. How to explain that admiration
might appear (to those who have perused the work) more
difficult; but the weakness of a parent is extreme, and
Gideon (and not his uncle, whose initials he had humorously
borrowed) was the author of &ldquo;Who Put Back the Clock?&rdquo;
He had never acknowledged it, or only to some intimate
friends while it was still in proof; after its appearance and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page336"></a>336</span>
alarming failure, the modesty of the novelist had become
more pressing, and the secret was now likely to be better
kept than that of the authorship of &ldquo;Waverley.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A copy of the work (for the date of my tale is already
yesterday) still figured in dusty solitude in the bookstall at
Waterloo; and Gideon, as he passed with his ticket for
Hampton Court, smiled contemptuously at the creature of
his thoughts. What an idle ambition was the author&rsquo;s!
How far beneath him was the practice of that childish art!
With his hand closing on his first brief, he felt himself a
man at last; and the muse who presides over the police
romance, a lady presumably of French extraction, fled
his neighbourhood, and returned to join the dance round
the springs of Helicon, among her Grecian sisters.</p>

<p>Robust, practical reflection still cheered the young
barrister upon his journey. Again and again he selected
the little country-house in its islet of great oaks, which
he was to make his future home. Like a prudent householder,
he projected improvements as he passed; to one
he added a stable, to another a tennis-court, a third he
supplied with a becoming rustic boat-house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How little a while ago,&rdquo; he could not but reflect,
&ldquo;I was a careless young dog with no thought but to be
comfortable! I cared for nothing but boating and detective
novels. I would have passed an old-fashioned country-house
with large kitchen-garden, stabling, boat-house, and
spacious offices, without so much as a look, and certainly
would have made no inquiry as to the drains. How a
man ripens with the years!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The intelligent reader will perceive the ravages of Miss
Hazeltine. Gideon had carried Julia straight to Mr.
Bloomfleld&rsquo;s house; and that gentleman, having been
led to understand she was the victim of oppression, had
noisily espoused her cause. He worked himself into a
fine breathing heat; in which, to a man of his temperament,
action became needful.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not know which is the worse,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page337"></a>337</span>
fraudulent old villain or the unmanly young cub. I will
write to the <i>Pall Mall</i> and expose them. Nonsense, sir;
they must be exposed! It&rsquo;s a public duty. Did you not
tell me the fellow was a Tory? O, the uncle is a Radical
lecturer, is he? No doubt the uncle has been grossly
wronged. But of course, as you say, that makes a change;
it becomes scarce so much a public duty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he sought and instantly found a fresh outlet for his
alacrity. Miss Hazeltine (he now perceived) must be kept
out of the way; his houseboat was lying ready&mdash;he had
returned but a day or two before from his usual cruise;
there was no place like a houseboat for concealment; and
that very morning, in the teeth of the easterly gale, Mr.
and Mrs. Bloomfield and Miss Julia Hazeltine had started
forth on their untimely voyage. Gideon pled in vain to
be allowed to join the party. &ldquo;No, Gid,&rdquo; said his uncle.
&ldquo;You will be watched; you must keep away from us.&rdquo;
Nor had the barrister ventured to contest this strange
illusion; for he feared if he rubbed off any of the romance,
that Mr. Bloomfield might weary of the whole affair. And
his discretion was rewarded; for the Squirradical, laying a
heavy hand upon his nephew&rsquo;s shoulder, had added these
notable expressions: &ldquo;I see what you are after, Gid. But
if you&rsquo;re going to get the girl, you have to work, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These pleasing sounds had cheered the barrister all
day, as he sat reading in chambers; they continued to
form the ground-base of his manly musings as he was
whirled to Hampton Court; even when he landed at the
station, and began to pull himself together for his delicate
interview, the voice of Uncle Ned and the eyes of Julia
were not forgotten.</p>

<p>But now it began to rain surprises: in all Hampton
Court there was no Kurnaul Villa, no Count Tarnow, and
no count. This was strange; but, viewed in the light of
the incoherency of his instructions, not perhaps inexplicable;
Mr. Dickson had been lunching, and he might have
made some fatal oversight in the address. What was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page338"></a>338</span>
the thoroughly prompt, manly, and business-like step?
thought Gideon; and he answered himself at once: &ldquo;A
telegram, very laconic.&rdquo; Speedily the wires were flashing
the following very important missive: &ldquo;Dickson, Langham
Hotel. Villa and persons both unknown here, suppose
erroneous address; follow self next train.&mdash;Forsyth.&rdquo; And
at the Langham Hotel, sure enough, with a brow expressive
of despatch and intellectual effort, Gideon descended not
long after from a smoking hansom.</p>

<p>I do not suppose that Gideon will ever forget the Langham
Hotel. No Count Tarnow was one thing; no John
Dickson and no Ezra Thomas, quite another. How, why,
and what next, danced in his bewildered brain; from
every centre of what we playfully call the human intellect
incongruous messages were telegraphed; and before the
hubbub of dismay had quite subsided, the barrister found
himself driving furiously for his chambers. There was at
least a cave of refuge; it was at least a place to think in;
and he climbed the stair, put his key in the lock and
opened the door, with some approach to hope.</p>

<p>It was all dark within, for the night had some time
fallen; but Gideon knew his room, he knew where the
matches stood on the end of the chimney-piece; and he
advanced boldly, and in so doing dashed himself against a
heavy body; where (slightly altering the expressions of the
song) no heavy body should have been. There had been
nothing there when Gideon went out; he had locked the
door behind him, he had found it locked on his return,
no one could have entered, the furniture could not have
changed its own position. And yet undeniably there was
a something there. He thrust out his hands in the darkness.
Yes, there was something, something large, something
smooth, something cold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive me!&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;it feels like a
piano.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And the next moment he remembered the vestas in his
waistcoat-pocket and had struck a light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page339"></a>339</span></p>

<p>It was indeed a piano that met his doubtful gaze; a
vast and costly instrument, stained with the rains of the
afternoon and defaced with recent scratches. The light
of the vesta was reflected from the varnished sides, like a
star in quiet water; and in the farther end of the room
the shadow of that strange visitor loomed bulkily and
wavered on the wall.</p>

<p>Gideon let the match burn to his fingers, and the darkness
closed once more on his bewilderment. Then with
trembling hands he lit the lamp and drew near. Near or
far, there was no doubt of the fact: the thing was a piano.
There, where by all the laws of God and man it was impossible
that it should be&mdash;there the thing impudently
stood. Gideon threw open the key-board and struck a
chord. Not a sound disturbed the quiet of the room. &ldquo;Is
there anything wrong with me?&rdquo; he thought, with a pang;
and drawing in a seat, obstinately persisted in his attempts
to ravish silence, now with sparkling arpeggios, now with a
sonata of Beethoven&rsquo;s which (in happier days) he knew to
be one of the loudest pieces of that powerful composer.
Still not a sound. He gave the Broadwood two great
bangs with his clenched first. All was still as the grave.</p>

<p>The young barrister started to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am stark-staring mad,&rdquo; he cried aloud, &ldquo;and no
one knows it but myself. God&rsquo;s worst curse has fallen
on me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His fingers encountered his watch-chain; instantly he
had plucked forth his watch and held it to his ear. He
could hear it ticking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not deaf,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;I am only insane.
My mind has quitted me for ever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked uneasily about the room, and gazed with lacklustre
eyes at the chair in which Mr. Dickson had installed
himself. The end of a cigar lay near on the fender.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe that was a dream;
but God knows my mind is failing rapidly. I seem to be
hungry, for instance; it&rsquo;s probably another hallucination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page340"></a>340</span>
Still I might try. I shall have one more good meal; I
shall go to the Caf√© Royal, and may possibly be removed
from there direct to the asylum.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wondered with morbid interest, as he descended the
stairs, how he would first betray his terrible condition&mdash;would
he attack a waiter? or eat glass?&mdash;and when he had
mounted into a cab, he bade the man drive to Nichol&rsquo;s,
with a lurking fear that there was no such place.</p>

<p>The flaring, gassy entrance of the caf√© speedily set his
mind at rest; he was cheered besides to recognise his
favourite waiter; his orders appeared to be coherent;
the dinner, when it came, was quite a sensible meal, and
he ate it with enjoyment. &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he reflected,
&ldquo;I am about tempted to indulge a hope. Have I been
hasty? Have I done what Robert Skill would have done?&rdquo;
Robert Skill (I need scarcely mention) was the name of the
principal character in &ldquo;Who Put Back the Clock?&rdquo; It
had occurred to the author as a brilliant and probable invention;
to readers of a critical turn, Robert appeared
scarce upon a level with his surname; but it is the difficulty
of the police romance, that the reader is always a man of
such vastly greater ingenuity than the writer. In the eyes
of his creator, however, Robert Skill was a word to conjure
with; the thought braced and spurred him; what that
brilliant creature would have done Gideon would do also.
This frame of mind is not uncommon; the distressed
general, the baited divine, the hesitating author, decide
severally to do what Napoleon, what St. Paul, what
Shakespeare would have done; and there remains only
the minor question, What is that? In Gideon&rsquo;s case one
thing was clear: Skill was a man of singular decision, he
would have taken some step (whatever it was) at once; and
the only step that Gideon could think of was to return to
his chambers.</p>

<p>This being achieved, all further inspiration failed him,
and he stood pitifully staring at the instrument of his confusion.
To touch the keys again was more than he durst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page341"></a>341</span>
venture on; whether they had maintained their former
silence, or responded with the tones of the last trump, it
would have equally dethroned his resolution. &ldquo;It may be
a practical jest,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;though it seems elaborate
and costly. And yet what else can it be? It <i>must</i> be a
practical jest.&rdquo; And just then his eye fell upon a feature
which seemed corroborative of that view: the pagoda of
cigars which Michael had erected ere he left the chambers.
&ldquo;Why that?&rdquo; reflected Gideon. &ldquo;It seems entirely irresponsible.&rdquo;
And drawing near, he gingerly demolished
it. &ldquo;A key,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Why that? And why so
conspicuously placed?&rdquo; He made the circuit of the instrument,
and perceived the keyhole at the back. &ldquo;Aha!
this is what the key is for,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;They wanted me to
look inside. Stranger and stranger.&rdquo; And with that he
turned the key and raised the lid.</p>

<p>In what antics of agony, in what fits of flighty resolution,
in what collapses of despair, Gideon consumed the night,
it would be ungenerous to inquire too closely.</p>

<p>That trill of tiny song with which the eaves-birds of
London welcome the approach of day found him limp and
rumpled and bloodshot, and with a mind still vacant of
resource. He rose and looked forth unrejoicingly on blinded
windows, an empty street, and the grey daylight dotted
with the yellow lamps. There are mornings when the city
seems to awake with a sick headache; this was one of
them; and still the twittering reveill√© of the sparrows
stirred in Gideon&rsquo;s spirit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Day here,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and I still helpless! This
must come to an end.&rdquo; And he locked up the piano, put
the key in his pocket; and set forth in quest of coffee. As
he went, his mind trudged for the hundredth time a certain
mill-road of terrors, misgivings, and regrets. To call in
the police, to give up the body, to cover London with
handbills describing John Dickson and Ezra Thomas, to fill
the papers with paragraphs, <i>Mysterious Occurrence in the
Temple&mdash;Mr. Forsyth admitted to bail</i>, this was one course,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page342"></a>342</span>
an easy course, a safe course; but not, the more he reflected
on it, not a pleasant one. For, was it not to publish
abroad a number of singular facts about himself? A child
ought to have seen through the story of these adventurers,
and he had gaped and swallowed it. A barrister of the least
self-respect should have refused to listen to clients who
came before him in a manner so irregular, and he had
listened. And O, if he had only listened; but he had gone
upon their errand&mdash;he, a barrister, uninstructed even by the
shadow of a solicitor&mdash;upon an errand fit only for a private
detective; and alas!&mdash;and for the hundredth time the
blood surged to his brow&mdash;he had taken their money!
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the thing is as plain as St. Paul&rsquo;s. I
shall be dishonoured! I have smashed my career for a
five-pound note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Between the possibility of being hanged in all innocence,
and the certainty of a public and merited disgrace, no
gentleman of spirit could long hesitate. After three gulps
of that hot, snuffy, and muddy beverage, that passes on
the streets of London for a decoction of the coffee berry,
Gideon&rsquo;s mind was made up. He would do without the
police. He must face the other side of the dilemma, and be
Robert Skill in earnest. What would Robert Skill have
done? How does a gentleman dispose of a dead body,
honestly come by? He remembered the inimitable story
of the hunchback; reviewed its course, and dismissed it for a
worthless guide. It was impossible to prop a corpse on the
corner of Tottenham Court Road without arousing fatal
curiosity in the bosoms of the passers-by; as for lowering
it down a London chimney, the physical obstacles were
insurmountable. To get it on board a train and drop it out,
or on the top of an omnibus and drop it off, were equally
out of the question. To get it on a yacht and drop it overboard,
was more conceivable; but for a man of moderate
means it seemed extravagant. The hire of the yacht was
in itself a consideration; the subsequent support of the
whole crew (which seemed a necessary consequence) was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page343"></a>343</span>
simply not to be thought of. His uncle and the houseboat
here occurred in very luminous colours to his mind. A
musical composer (say, of the name of Jimson) might very
well suffer, like Hogarth&rsquo;s musician before him, from the
disturbances of London. He might very well be pressed
for time to finish an opera&mdash;say the comic opera <i>Orange
Pekoe</i>&mdash;<i>Orange Pekoe</i>, music by Jimson&mdash;&ldquo;this young
ma√´stro, one of the most promising of our recent English
school&rdquo;&mdash;vigorous entrance of the drums, etc.&mdash;the whole
character of Jimson and his music arose in bulk before the
mind of Gideon. What more likely than Jimson&rsquo;s arrival
with a grand piano (say, at Padwick), and his residence in a
houseboat alone with the unfinished score of <i>Orange Pekoe</i>?
His subsequent disappearance, leaving nothing behind but
an empty piano case, it might be more difficult to account
for. And yet even that was susceptible of explanation.
For, suppose Jimson had gone mad over a fugal passage,
and had thereupon destroyed the accomplice of his infamy,
and plunged into the welcome river? What end, on the
whole, more probable for a modern musician?</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; cried Gideon. &ldquo;Jimson is the
boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page344"></a>344</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XI</h3>

<h5>THE MA√ãSTRO JIMSON</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Mr. Edward Hugh Bloomfield</span> having announced his
intention to stay in the neighbourhood of Maidenhead, what
more probable than that the Ma√´stro Jimson should turn his
mind toward Padwick? Near this pleasant river-side
village he remembered to have observed an ancient, weedy
houseboat lying moored beside a tuft of willows. It had
stirred in him, in his careless hours, as he pulled down the
river under a more familiar name, a certain sense of the
romantic; and when the nice contrivance of his story was
already complete in his mind, he had come near pulling
it all down again, like an ungrateful clock, in order to
introduce a chapter in which Richard Skill (who was always
being decoyed somewhere) should be decoyed on board that
lonely hulk by Lord Bellew and the American desperado
Gin Sling. It was fortunate he had not done so, he reflected,
since the hulk was now required for very different
purposes.</p>

<p>Jimson, a man of inconspicuous costume, but insinuating
manners, had little difficulty in finding the hireling who had
charge of the houseboat, and still less in persuading him to
resign his care. The rent was almost nominal, the entry
immediate, the key was exchanged against a suitable
advance in money, and Jimson returned to town by the
afternoon train to see about despatching his piano.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will be down to-morrow,&rdquo; he had said reassuringly.
&ldquo;My opera is waited for with such impatience, you
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And, sure enough, about the hour of noon on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page345"></a>345</span>
following day, Jimson might have been observed ascending
the river-side road that goes from Padwick to Great Haverham,
carrying in one hand a basket of provisions, and under
the other arm a leather case containing (it is to be conjectured)
the score of <i>Orange Pekoe</i>. It was October
weather; the stone-grey sky was full of larks, the leaden
mirror of the Thames brightened with autumnal foliage,
and the fallen leaves of the chestnuts chirped under the
composer&rsquo;s footing. There is no time of the year in
England more courageous; and Jimson, though he was not
without his troubles, whistled as he went.</p>

<p>A little above Padwick the river lies very solitary. On
the opposite shore the trees of a private park enclose the
view, the chimneys of the mansion just pricking forth
above their clusters; on the near side the path is bordered
by willows. Close among these lay the houseboat, a thing
so soiled by the tears of the overhanging willows, so grown
upon with parasites, so decayed, so battered, so neglected,
such a haunt of rats, so advertised a storehouse of rheumatic
agonies, that the heart of an intending occupant might well
recoil. A plank, by way of flying drawbridge, joined it
to the shore. And it was a dreary moment for Jimson when
he pulled this after him and found himself alone on this
unwholesome fortress. He could hear the rats scuttle and
flop in the abhorred interior; the key cried among the
wards like a thing in pain; the sitting-room was deep in
dust, and smelt strong of bilge-water. It could not be
called a cheerful spot, even for a composer absorbed in
beloved toil; how much less for a young gentleman haunted
by alarms and awaiting the arrival of a corpse!</p>

<p>He sat down, cleared away a piece of the table, and
attacked the cold luncheon in his basket. In case of any
subsequent inquiry into the fate of Jimson, it was desirable
he should be little seen: in other words, that he
should spend the day entirely in the house. To this end,
and further to corroborate his fable, he had brought in the
leather case not only writing materials, but a ream of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page346"></a>346</span>
large-size music paper, such as he considered suitable for an
ambitious character like Jimson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now to work,&rdquo; said he, when he had satisfied his
appetite. &ldquo;We must leave traces of the wretched man&rsquo;s
activity.&rdquo; And he wrote in bold characters:</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="center">ORANGE PEKOE.</p>
<p class="center f80"><i>Op. 17.</i><br />
J. B. JIMSON.<br />
Vocal and p. f. score.</p>
<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose they never do begin like this,&rdquo; reflected
Gideon; &ldquo;but then it&rsquo;s quite out of the question for me
to tackle a full score, and Jimson was so unconventional.
A dedication would be found convincing, I believe. &lsquo;Dedicated
to&rsquo; (let me see) &lsquo;to William Ewart Gladstone, by his
obedient servant the composer.&rsquo; And now some music:
I had better avoid the overture; it seems to present
difficulties. Let&rsquo;s give an air for the tenor: key&mdash;O, something
modern!&mdash;seven sharps.&rdquo; And he made a business-like
signature across the staves, and then paused and
browsed for a while on the handle of his pen. Melody,
with no better inspiration than a sheet of paper, is not
usually found to spring unbidden in the mind of the
amateur; nor is the key of seven sharps a place of much
repose to the untried. He cast away that sheet. &ldquo;It will
help to build up the character of Jimson,&rdquo; Gideon remarked,
and again waited on the muse, in various keys and on
divers sheets of paper, but all with results so inconsiderable
that he stood aghast. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd,&rdquo; thought he. &ldquo;I
seem to have less fancy than I thought, or this is an
off-day with me; yet Jimson must leave something.&rdquo;
And again he bent himself to the task.</p>

<p>Presently the penetrating chill of the houseboat began
to attack the very seat of life. He desisted from his unremunerative
trial, and, to the audible annoyance of the
rats, walked briskly up and down the cabin. Still he was
cold. &ldquo;This is all nonsense,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page347"></a>347</span>
about the risk, but I will not catch a catarrh. I must get
out of this den.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped on deck, and passing to the bow of his
embarkation, looked for the first time up the river. He
started. Only a few hundred yards above another houseboat
lay moored among the willows. It was very spick-and-span,
an elegant canoe hung at the stern, the windows
were concealed by snowy curtains, a flag floated from a
staff. The more Gideon looked at it, the more there
mingled with his disgust a sense of impotent surprise. It
was very like his uncle&rsquo;s houseboat; it was exceedingly
like&mdash;it was identical. But for two circumstances, he
could have sworn it was the same. The first, that his uncle
had gone to Maidenhead, might be explained away by that
flightiness of purpose which is so common a trait among
the more than usually manly. The second, however, was
conclusive: it was not in the least like Mr. Bloomfield to
display a banner on his floating residence; and if he ever
did, it would certainly be dyed in hues of emblematical
propriety. Now the Squirradical, like the vast majority
of the more manly, had drawn knowledge at the wells of
Cambridge&mdash;he was wooden spoon in the year 1850; and
the flag upon the houseboat streamed on the afternoon air
with the colours of that seat of Toryism, that cradle of
Puseyism, that home of the inexact and the effete&mdash;Oxford.</p>

<p>Still it was strangely like, thought Gideon.</p>

<p>And as he thus looked and thought, the door opened,
and a young lady stepped forth on deck. The barrister
dropped and fled into his cabin&mdash;it was Julia Hazeltine!
Through the window he watched her draw in the canoe,
get on board of it, cast off, and come dropping down stream
in his direction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all is up now,&rdquo; said he, and he fell on a seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon, miss,&rdquo; said a voice on the water.
Gideon knew it for the voice of his landlord.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon,&rdquo; replied Julia, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page348"></a>348</span>
who you are; do I? O yes, I do though. You are the
nice man that gave us leave to sketch from the old
houseboat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon&rsquo;s heart leaped with fear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; returned the man. &ldquo;And what I wanted
to say was as you couldn&rsquo;t do it any more. You see I&rsquo;ve
let it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it!&rdquo; cried Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let it for a month,&rdquo; said the man. &ldquo;Seems strange,
don&rsquo;t it? Can&rsquo;t see what the party wants with it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems very romantic of him, I think,&rdquo; said Julia,
&ldquo;What sort of a person is he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia in her canoe, the landlord in his wherry, were
close alongside, and holding on by the gunwale of the
houseboat; so that not a word was lost on Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a music-man,&rdquo; said the landlord, &ldquo;or at least
that&rsquo;s what he told me, miss; come down here to write
an op&rsquo;ra.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; cried Julia, &ldquo;I never heard of anything so
delightful! Why, we shall be able to slip down at night
and hear him improvise! What is his name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimson,&rdquo; said the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jimson?&rdquo; repeated Julia, and interrogated her
memory in vain. But indeed our rising school of English
music boasts so many professors that we rarely hear of
one till he is made a baronet. &ldquo;Are you sure you have
it right?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Made him spell it to me,&rdquo; replied the landlord.
&ldquo;J-I-M-S-O-N&mdash;Jimson; and his op&rsquo;ra&rsquo;s called&mdash;some
kind of tea.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Some kind of tea!</i>&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;What a very
singular name for an opera! What can it be about?&rdquo;
And Gideon heard her pretty laughter flow abroad. &ldquo;We
must try to get acquainted with this Mr. Jimson; I feel
sure he must be nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, miss, I&rsquo;m afraid I must be going on. I&rsquo;ve
got to be at Haverham, you see.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page349"></a>349</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t let me keep you, you kind man!&rdquo; said Julia.
&ldquo;Good-afternoon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-afternoon to you, miss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon sat in the cabin a prey to the most harrowing
thoughts. Here he was anchored to a rotting houseboat,
soon to be anchored to it still more emphatically by the
presence of the corpse, and here was the country buzzing
about him, and young ladies already proposing pleasure
parties to surround his house at night. Well, that meant
the gallows; and much he cared for that. What troubled
him now was Julia&rsquo;s indescribable levity. That girl would
scrape acquaintance with anybody; she had no reserve,
none of the enamel of the lady. She was familiar with a
brute like his landlord; she took an immediate interest
(which she lacked even the delicacy to conceal) in a creature
like Jimson! He could conceive her asking Jimson to
have tea with her! And it was for a girl like this that a
man like Gideon&mdash;&mdash; Down, manly heart!</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sound that sent him whipping
behind the door in a trice. Miss Hazeltine had stepped
on board the houseboat. Her sketch was promising;
judging from the stillness, she supposed Jimson not yet
come; and she had decided to seize occasion and complete
the work of art. Down she sat therefore in the bow, produced
her block and water-colours, and was soon singing
over (what used to be called) the ladylike accomplishment.
Now and then indeed her song was interrupted, as she
searched in her memory for some of the odious little receipts
by means of which the game is practised&mdash;or used to be
practised in the brave days of old; they say the world,
and those ornaments of the world, young ladies, are become
more sophisticated now; but Julia had probably studied
under Pitman, and she stood firm in the old ways.</p>

<p>Gideon, meanwhile, stood behind the door, afraid to
move, afraid to breathe, afraid to think of what must follow,
racked by confinement and borne to the ground with
tedium. This particular phase, he felt with gratitude,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page350"></a>350</span>
could not last for ever; whatever impended (even the
gallows, he bitterly and perhaps erroneously reflected) could
not fail to be a relief. To calculate cubes occurred to him
as an ingenious and even profitable refuge from distressing
thoughts, and he threw his manhood into that dreary
exercise.</p>

<p>Thus, then, were these two young persons occupied&mdash;Gideon
attacking the perfect number with resolution;
Julia vigorously stippling incongruous colours on her block,
when Providence despatched into these waters a steam-launch
asthmatically panting up the Thames. All along
the banks the water swelled and fell, and the reeds rustled.
The houseboat itself, that ancient stationary creature,
became suddenly imbued with life, and rolled briskly at her
moorings, like a sea-going ship when she begins to smell the
harbour bar. The wash had nearly died away, and the
quick panting of the launch sounded already faint and far
off, when Gideon was startled by a cry from Julia. Peering
through the window, he beheld her staring disconsolately
down stream at the fast-vanishing canoe. The barrister
(whatever were his faults) displayed on this occasion a
promptitude worthy of his hero, Robert Skill; with one
effort of his mind he foresaw what was about to follow;
with one movement of his body he dropped to the floor
and crawled under the table.</p>

<p>Julia, on her part, was not yet alive to her position.
She saw she had lost the canoe, and she looked forward with
something less than avidity to her next interview with
Mr. Bloomfield; but she had no idea that she was imprisoned,
for she knew of the plank bridge.</p>

<p>She made the circuit of the house, and found the door
open and the bridge withdrawn. It was plain, then,
that Jimson must have come; plain, too, that he must be
on board. He must be a very shy man to have suffered
this invasion of his residence, and made no sign; and her
courage rose higher at the thought. He must come now,
she must force him from his privacy, for the plank was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page351"></a>351</span>
too heavy for her single strength; so she tapped upon the
open door. Then she tapped again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jimson,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;Mr. Jimson! here, come!&mdash;you
<i>must</i> come, you know, sooner or later, for I can&rsquo;t
get off without you. O, don&rsquo;t be so exceedingly silly!
O, please, come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still there was no reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he <i>is</i> here he must be mad,&rdquo; she thought, with a
little fear. And the next moment she remembered he had
probably gone aboard like herself in a boat. In that case
she might as well see the houseboat, and she pushed open
the door and stepped in. Under the table, where he lay
smothered with dust, Gideon&rsquo;s heart stood still.</p>

<p>There were the remains of Jimson&rsquo;s lunch. &ldquo;He likes
rather nice things to eat,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;O, I am sure
he is quite a delightful man. I wonder if he is as good-looking
as Mr. Forsyth. Mrs. Jimson&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe it
sounds as nice as Mrs. Forsyth; but then &lsquo;Gideon&rsquo; is so
really odious! And here is some of his music too; this is
delightful. <i>Orange Pekoe</i>&mdash;O, that&rsquo;s what he meant by
some kind of tea.&rdquo; And she trilled with laughter.
&ldquo;<i>Adagio molto espressivo, sempre legato</i>,&rdquo; she read next.
(For the literary part of a composer&rsquo;s business Gideon was
well equipped.) &ldquo;How very strange to have all these
directions, and only three or four notes! O, here&rsquo;s another
with some more. <i>Andante patetico.</i>&rdquo; And she began to
glance over the music. &ldquo;O dear me,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;he
must be terribly modern! It all seems discords to me.
Let&rsquo;s try the air. It is very strange, it seems familiar.&rdquo;
She began to sing it, and suddenly broke off with laughter.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Tommy make room for your Uncle!&rsquo;&rdquo; she
cried aloud, so that the soul of Gideon was filled with
bitterness. &ldquo;<i>Andante patetico</i>, indeed! The man must
be a mere impostor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And just at this moment there came a confused, scuffling
sound from underneath the table; a strange note, like that
of a barn-door fowl, ushered in a most explosive sneeze;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page352"></a>352</span>
the head of the sufferer was at the same time brought
smartly in contact with the boards above; and the sneeze
was followed by a hollow groan.</p>

<p>Julia fled to the door, and there, with the salutary
instinct of the brave, turned and faced the danger. There
was no pursuit. The sounds continued; below the table
a crouching figure was indistinctly to be seen jostled by the
throes of a sneezing-fit; and that was all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; thought Julia, &ldquo;this is most unusual behaviour.
He cannot be a man of the world!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the dust of years had been disturbed by the
young barrister&rsquo;s convulsions; and the sneezing-fit was
succeeded by a passionate access of coughing.</p>

<p>Julia began to feel a certain interest. &ldquo;I am afraid
you are really quite ill,&rdquo; she said, drawing a little nearer.
&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t let me put you out, and do not stay under
that table, Mr. Jimson. Indeed it cannot be good for
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jimson only answered by a distressing cough; and
the next moment the girl was on her knees, and their faces
had almost knocked together under the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, my gracious goodness!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Hazeltine,
and sprang to her feet. &ldquo;Mr. Forsyth gone mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am not mad,&rdquo; said the gentleman ruefully, extricating
himself from his position. &ldquo;Dearest Miss Hazeltine,
I vow to you upon my knees I am not mad!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are not!&rdquo; she cried, panting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that to a superficial eye my
conduct may appear unconventional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you are not mad, it was no conduct at all,&rdquo; cried
the girl, with a flash of colour, &ldquo;and showed you did not
care one penny for my feelings!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the very devil and all. I know&mdash;I admit
that,&rdquo; cried Gideon, with a great effort of manly candour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was abominable conduct!&rdquo; said Julia, with
energy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it must have shaken your esteem,&rdquo; said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page353"></a>353</span>
barrister. &ldquo;But, dearest Miss Hazeltine, I beg of you to
hear me out; my behaviour, strange as it may seem, is not
unsusceptible of explanation; and I positively cannot and
will not consent to continue to try to exist without&mdash;without
the esteem of one whom I admire&mdash;the moment is ill chosen,
I am well aware of that; but I repeat the expression&mdash;one
whom I admire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A touch of amusement appeared on Miss Hazeltine&rsquo;s
face. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;come out of this dreadfully
cold place, and let us sit down on deck.&rdquo; The barrister dolefully
followed her. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said she, making herself comfortable
against the end of the house, &ldquo;go on. I will hear
you out.&rdquo; And then, seeing him stand before her with so
much obvious disrelish to the task, she was suddenly overcome
with laughter. Julia&rsquo;s laugh was a thing to ravish
lovers; she rolled her mirthful descant with the freedom
and the melody of a blackbird&rsquo;s song upon the river, and
repeated by the echoes of the farther bank. It seemed a
thing in its own place and a sound native to the open
air. There was only one creature who heard it without joy,
and that was her unfortunate admirer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Hazeltine,&rdquo; he said, in a voice that tottered with
annoyance, &ldquo;I speak as your sincere well-wisher, but this
can only be called levity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia made great eyes at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t withdraw the word,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;already the
freedom with which I heard you hobnobbing with a boatman
gave me exquisite pain. Then there was a want of
reserve about Jimson&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Jimson appears to be yourself,&rdquo; objected Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am far from denying that,&rdquo; cried the barrister,
&ldquo;but you did not know it at the time. What could Jimson
be to you? Who was Jimson? Miss Hazeltine, it cut
me to the heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really this seems to me to be very silly,&rdquo; returned
Julia, with severe decision. &ldquo;You have behaved in the
most extraordinary manner; you pretend you are able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page354"></a>354</span>
to explain your conduct, and instead of doing so you
begin to attack me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am well aware of that,&rdquo; replied Gideon. &ldquo;I&mdash;I
will make a clean breast of it. When you know all the
circumstances you will be able to excuse me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And sitting down beside her on the deck, he poured
forth his miserable history.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Forsyth,&rdquo; she cried, when he had done, &ldquo;I
am&mdash;so&mdash;sorry! I wish I hadn&rsquo;t laughed at you&mdash;only
you know you really were so exceedingly funny. But I
wish I hadn&rsquo;t, and I wouldn&rsquo;t either if I had only known.&rdquo;
And she gave him her hand.</p>

<p>Gideon kept it in his own. &ldquo;You do not think the
worse of me for this?&rdquo; he asked tenderly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you have been so silly and got into such
dreadful trouble? you poor boy, no!&rdquo; cried Julia; and,
in the warmth of the moment, reached him her other
hand; &ldquo;you may count on me,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really and really!&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do then, and I will,&rdquo; cried the young man. &ldquo;I
admit the moment is not well chosen; but I have no friends&mdash;to
speak of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No more have I,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you think
it&rsquo;s perhaps time you gave me back my hands?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>La ci darem la mano</i>,&rdquo; said the barrister, &ldquo;the merest
moment more! I have so few friends,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was considered such a bad account of a
young man to have no friends,&rdquo; observed Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, but I have crowds of <i>friends</i>!&rdquo; cried Gideon.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not what I mean. I feel the moment is ill chosen;
but O, Julia, if you could only see yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Forsyth&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call me by that beastly name!&rdquo; cried the youth.
&ldquo;Call me Gideon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, never that!&rdquo; from Julia. &ldquo;Besides, we have
known each other such a short time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page355"></a>355</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; protested Gideon. &ldquo;We met at Bournemouth
ever so long ago. I never forgot you since. Say
you never forgot me. Say you never forgot me, and call
me Gideon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this rather&mdash;a want of reserve about Jimson?&rdquo;
inquired the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I know I am an ass,&rdquo; cried the barrister, &ldquo;and
I don&rsquo;t care a halfpenny! I know I&rsquo;m an ass, and you
may laugh at me to your heart&rsquo;s delight.&rdquo; And as Julia&rsquo;s
lips opened with a smile, he once more dropped into music.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Land of Cherry Isle!&rdquo; he sang, courting her
with his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like an opera,&rdquo; said Julia, rather faintly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What should it be?&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;Am I not Jimson?
It would be strange if I did not serenade my love.
O yes, I mean the word, my Julia; and I mean to win
you. I am in dreadful trouble, and I have not a penny
of my own, and I have cut the silliest figure; and yet
I mean to win you, Julia. Look at me, if you can, and
tell me no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him; and whatever her eyes may have
told him, it is to be supposed he took a pleasure in the
message, for he read it a long while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And Uncle Ned will give us some money to go on
upon in the meanwhile,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I call that cool!&rdquo; said a cheerful voice at his
elbow.</p>

<p>Gideon and Julia sprang apart with wonderful alacrity;
the latter annoyed to observe that although they had
never moved since they sat down, they were now quite
close together; both presenting faces of a very heightened
colour to the eyes of Mr. Edward Hugh Bloomfield. That
gentleman, coming up the river in his boat, had captured
the truant canoe, and divining what had happened, had
thought to steal a march upon Miss Hazeltine at her
sketch. He had unexpectedly brought down two birds
with one stone; and as he looked upon the pair of flushed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page356"></a>356</span>
and breathless culprits, the pleasant human instinct of
the matchmaker softened his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I call that cool,&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;you seem to
count very securely upon Uncle Ned. But look here, Gid,
I thought I had told you to keep away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To keep away from Maidenhead,&rdquo; replied Gid. &ldquo;But
how should I expect to find you here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is something in that,&rdquo; Mr. Bloomfield admitted.
&ldquo;You see I thought it better that even you should be
ignorant of my address; those rascals, the Finsburys,
would have wormed it out of you. And just to put them
off the scent I hoisted these abominable colours. But
that is not all, Gid; you promised me to work, and here I
find you playing the fool at Padwick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Bloomfield, you must not be hard on Mr.
Forsyth,&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;Poor boy, he is in dreadful straits.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Gid?&rdquo; inquired the uncle. &ldquo;Have
you been fighting? or is it a bill?&rdquo;</p>

<p>These, in the opinion of the Squirradical, were the two
misfortunes incident to gentlemen; and indeed both were
culled from his own career. He had once put his name
(as a matter of form) on a friend&rsquo;s paper; it had cost him a
cool thousand; and the friend had gone about with the
fear of death upon him ever since, and never turned a corner
without scouting in front of him for Mr. Bloomfield and
the oaken staff. As for fighting, the Squirradical was
always on the brink of it; and once, when (in the character
of president of a Radical club) he had cleared out the hall
of his opponents, things had gone even further. Mr.
Holtum, the Conservative candidate, who lay so long on the
bed of sickness, was prepared to swear to Mr. Bloomfield.
&ldquo;I will swear to it in any court&mdash;it was the hand of that
brute that struck me down,&rdquo; he was reported to have said;
and when he was thought to be sinking, it was known that
he had made an <i>ante-mortem</i> statement in that sense. It was
a cheerful day for the Squirradical when Holtum was
restored to his brewery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page357"></a>357</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much worse than that,&rdquo; said Gideon; &ldquo;a combination
of circumstances really providentially unjust&mdash;a&mdash;in
fact, a syndicate of murderers seem to have perceived
my latent ability to rid them of the traces of their crime.
It&rsquo;s a legal study after all, you see!&rdquo; And with these
words, Gideon, for the second time that day, began to
describe the adventures of the Broadwood Grand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must write to the <i>Times</i>,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bloomfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to get me disbarred?&rdquo; asked Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disbarred! Come, it can&rsquo;t be as bad as that,&rdquo; said
his uncle. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good, honest, Liberal Government that&rsquo;s
in, and they would certainly move at my request. Thank
God, the days of Tory jobbery are at an end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do, Uncle Ned,&rdquo; said Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re not mad enough,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bloomfield,
&ldquo;to persist in trying to dispose of it yourself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no other path open to me,&rdquo; said Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not common-sense, and I will not hear of it,&rdquo; cried
Mr. Bloomfield. &ldquo;I command you, positively, Gid, to desist
from this criminal interference.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, I hand it over to you,&rdquo; said Gideon,
&ldquo;and you can do what you like with the dead body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God forbid!&rdquo; ejaculated the president of the Radical
Club, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have nothing to do with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you must allow me to do the best I can,&rdquo;
returned his nephew. &ldquo;Believe me, I have a distinct
talent for this sort of difficulty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We might forward it to that pest-house, the Conservative
Club,&rdquo; observed Mr. Bloomfield. &ldquo;It might
damage them in the eyes of their constituents; and it
could be profitably worked up in the local journal.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you see any political capital in the thing,&rdquo; said
Gideon, &ldquo;you may have it for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no, Gid&mdash;no, no, I thought <i>you</i> might. I will
have no hand in the thing. On reflection, it&rsquo;s highly
undesirable that either I or Miss Hazeltine should linger
here. We might be observed,&rdquo; said the president, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"></a>358</span>
up and down the river; &ldquo;and in my public position the
consequences would be painful for the party. And, at
any rate, it&rsquo;s dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Gideon, plunging for his watch. &ldquo;And
so it is! Great heaven, the piano should have been here
hours ago!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomfield was clambering back into his boat; but
at these words he paused.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw it arrive myself at the station; I hired a carrier
man; he had a round to make, but he was to be here by
four at the latest,&rdquo; cried the barrister. &ldquo;No doubt the
piano is open, and the body found.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must fly at once,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bloomfield, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
the only manly step.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But suppose it&rsquo;s all right?&rdquo; wailed Gideon. &ldquo;Suppose
the piano comes, and I am not here to receive it?
I shall have hanged myself by my cowardice. No, Uncle
Ned, inquiries must be made in Padwick; I dare not go,
of course; but you may&mdash;you could hang about the police
office, don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Gid&mdash;no, my dear nephew,&rdquo; said Mr. Bloomfield,
with the voice of one on the rack. &ldquo;I regard you with
the most sacred affection; and I thank God I am an
Englishman&mdash;and all that. But not&mdash;not the police,
Gid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you desert me?&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;Say it
plainly.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Far from it! far from it!&rdquo; protested Mr. Bloomfield.
&ldquo;I only propose caution. Common-sense, Gid, should
always be an Englishman&rsquo;s guide.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will you let me speak?&rdquo; said Julia. &ldquo;I think Gideon
had better leave this dreadful houseboat, and wait among
the willows over there. If the piano comes, then he could
step out and take it in; and if the police come, he could
slip into our houseboat, and there needn&rsquo;t be any more
Jimson at all. He could go to bed, and we could burn his
clothes (couldn&rsquo;t we?) in the steam-launch; and then really
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page359"></a>359</span>
it seems as if it would be all right. Mr. Bloomfield is so
respectable, you know, and such a leading character, it
would be quite impossible even to fancy that he could be
mixed up with it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This young lady has strong common-sense,&rdquo; said
the Squirradical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m at all a fool,&rdquo; said Julia, with
conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what if neither of them come?&rdquo; asked Gideon;
&ldquo;what shall I do then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why then,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you had better go down to the
village after dark; and I can go with you, and then I am
sure you could never be suspected; and even if you were,
I could tell them it was altogether a mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will not permit that&mdash;I will not suffer Miss Hazeltine
to go,&rdquo; cried Mr. Bloomfield.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Julia.</p>

<p>Mr. Bloomfield had not the least desire to tell her why,
for it was simply a craven fear of being drawn himself
into the imbroglio; but with the usual tactics of a man
who is ashamed of himself, he took the high hand. &ldquo;God
forbid, my dear Miss Hazeltine, that I should dictate to a
lady on the question of propriety&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; he began.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, is that all?&rdquo; interrupted Julia. &ldquo;Then we must
go all three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Caught!&rdquo; thought the Squirradical.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XII</h3>

<h5>POSITIVELY THE LAST APPEARANCE OF THE
BROADWOOD GRAND</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">England</span> is supposed to be unmusical; but without
dwelling on the patronage extended to the organ-grinder,
without seeking to found any argument on the prevalence of
the jew&rsquo;s trump, there is surely one instrument that may
be said to be national in the fullest acceptance of the word.
The herdboy in the broom, already musical in the days of
Father Chaucer, startles (and perhaps pains) the lark with
this exiguous pipe; and in the hands of the skilled brick-layer,</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>
<p class="center f80">&ldquo;The thing becomes a trumpet, whence he blows&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>

<p class="noind">(as a general rule) either &ldquo;The British Grenadiers&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Cherry Ripe.&rdquo; The latter air is indeed the shibboleth and
diploma piece of the penny whistler; I hazard a guess it
was originally composed for this instrument. It is singular
enough that a man should be able to gain a livelihood, or
even to tide over a period of unemployment, by the display
of his proficiency upon the penny whistle; still more so,
that the professional should almost invariably confine
himself to &ldquo;Cherry Ripe.&rdquo; But indeed, singularities
surround the subject, thick like blackberries. Why, for
instance, should the pipe be called a penny whistle? I
think no one ever bought it for a penny. Why should
the alternative name be tin whistle? I am grossly deceived
if it be made of tin. Lastly, in what deaf catacomb, in
what earless desert, does the beginner pass the excruciating
interval of his apprenticeship? We have all heard people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page361"></a>361</span>
learning the piano, the fiddle, and the cornet; but the young
of the penny whistler (like that of the salmon) is occult
from observation; he is never heard until proficient; and
providence (perhaps alarmed by the works of Mr. Mallock)
defends human hearing from his first attempts upon the
upper octave.</p>

<p>A really noteworthy thing was taking place in a green
lane, not far from Padwick. On the bench of a carrier&rsquo;s
cart there sat a tow-headed, lanky, modest-looking youth;
the reins were on his lap; the whip lay behind him in the
interior of the cart; the horse proceeded without guidance
or encouragement; the carrier (or the carrier&rsquo;s man), rapt
into a higher sphere than that of his daily occupations, his
looks dwelling on the skies, devoted himself wholly to a
brand-new D penny whistle, whence he diffidently endeavoured
to elicit that pleasing melody &ldquo;The Ploughboy.&rdquo;
To any observant person who should have chanced to
saunter in that lane, the hour would have been thrilling.
&ldquo;Here at last,&rdquo; he would have said, &ldquo;is the
beginner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tow-headed youth (whose name was Harker) had
just encored himself for the nineteenth time, when he was
struck into the extreme of confusion by the discovery that
he was not alone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; cried a manly voice from the
side of the road. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s as good as I want to hear.
Perhaps a leetle oilier in the run,&rdquo; the voice suggested,
with meditative gusto. &ldquo;Give it us again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Harker glanced, from the depths of his humiliation, at
the speaker. He beheld a powerful, sun-brown, clean-shaven
fellow, about forty years of age, striding beside the cart with
a non-commissioned military bearing, and (as he strode)
spinning in the air a cane. The fellow&rsquo;s clothes were very
bad, but he looked clean and self-reliant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m only a beginner,&rdquo; gasped the blushing Harker,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think anybody could hear me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I like that!&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page362"></a>362</span>
pretty old beginner. Come, I&rsquo;ll give you a lead myself.
Give us a seat here beside you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment the military gentleman was perched
on the cart, pipe in hand. He gave the instrument a
knowing rattle on the shaft, mouthed it, appeared to
commune for a moment with the muse, and dashed into
&ldquo;The girl I left behind me.&rdquo; He was a great, rather than
a fine, performer; he lacked the bird-like richness; he
could scarce have extracted all the honey out of &ldquo;Cherry
Ripe&ldquo;; he did not fear&mdash;he even ostentatiously displayed
and seemed to revel in&mdash;the shrillness of the instrument;
but in fire, speed, precision, evenness, and fluency; in
linked agility of <i>jimmy</i>&mdash;a technical expression, by your
leave, answering to <i>warblers</i> on the bagpipe; and perhaps,
above all, in that inspiring side-glance of the eye, with
which he followed the effect and (as by a human appeal)
eked out the insufficiency of his performance: in these, the
fellow stood without a rival. Harker listened: &ldquo;The girl I
left behind me&rdquo; filled him with despair; &ldquo;The Soldier&rsquo;s
Joy&rdquo; carried him beyond jealousy into generous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Turn about,&rdquo; said the military gentleman, offering
the pipe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, not after you!&rdquo; cried Harker; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a professional.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said his companion; &ldquo;an amatyure like yourself.
That&rsquo;s one style of play, yours is the other, and I like it best.
But I began when I was a boy, you see, before my taste
was formed. When you&rsquo;re my age you&rsquo;ll play that thing like
a cornet-√†-piston. Give us that air again; how does it go?&rdquo;
and he affected to endeavour to recall &ldquo;The Ploughboy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A timid, insane hope sprang in the breast of Harker.
Was it possible? Was there something in his playing?
It had, indeed, seemed to him at times as if he got a kind
of a richness out of it. Was he a genius? Meantime the
military gentleman stumbled over the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the unhappy Harker, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not quite it.
It goes this way&mdash;just to show you.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"></a>363</span>
And, taking the pipe between his lips, he sealed his
doom. When he had played the air, and then a second time,
and a third; when the military gentleman had tried it
once more, and once more failed; when it became clear to
Harker that he, the blushing d√©butant, was actually giving
a lesson to this full-grown flutist&mdash;and the flutist under
his care was not very brilliantly progressing&mdash;how am I
to tell what floods of glory brightened the autumnal
countryside; how, unless the reader were an amateur
himself, describe the heights of idiotic vanity to which the
carrier climbed? One significant fact shall paint the
situation: thenceforth it was Harker who played, and
the military gentleman listened and approved.</p>

<p>As he listened, however, he did not forget the habit
of soldierly precaution, looking both behind and before.
He looked behind and computed the value of the carrier&rsquo;s
load, divining the contents of the brown-paper parcels and
the portly hamper, and briefly setting down the grand
piano in the brand-new piano-case as &ldquo;difficult to get rid
of.&rdquo; He looked before, and spied at the corner of the green
lane a little country public-house embowered in roses.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a shy at it,&rdquo; concluded the military gentleman,
and roundly proposed a glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m not a drinking man,&rdquo; said Harker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, now,&rdquo; cut in the other, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you who
I am: I&rsquo;m Colour-Sergeant Brand of the Blankth. That&rsquo;ll
tell you if I&rsquo;m a drinking man or not.&rdquo; It might and it
might not, thus a Greek chorus would have intervened, and
gone on to point out how very far it fell short of telling
why the sergeant was tramping a country lane in tatters;
or even to argue that he must have pretermitted some
while ago his labours for the general defence, and (in the
interval) possibly turned his attention to oakum. But
there was no Greek chorus present; and the man of war
went on to contend that drinking was one thing and a
friendly glass another.</p>

<p>In the Blue Lion, which was the name of the country
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page364"></a>364</span>
public-house, Colour-Sergeant Brand introduced his new
friend, Mr. Harker, to a number of ingenious mixtures,
calculated to prevent the approaches of intoxication.
These he explained to be &ldquo;rekisite&rdquo; in the service, so that
a self-respecting officer should always appear upon parade
in a condition honourable to his corps. The most efficacious
of these devices was to lace a pint of mild ale with twopence-worth
of London gin. I am pleased to hand in this recipe
to the discerning reader, who may find it useful even in
civil station; for its effect upon Mr. Harker was revolutionary.
He must be helped on board his own waggon, where
he proceeded to display a spirit entirely given over to mirth
and music, alternately hooting with laughter, to which the
sergeant hastened to bear chorus, and incoherently tootling
on the pipe. The man of war, meantime, unostentatiously
possessed himself of the reins. It was plain he had a taste
for the secluded beauties of an English landscape; for the
cart, although it wandered under his guidance for some
time, was never observed to issue on the dusty highway,
journeying between hedge and ditch, and for the most part
under overhanging boughs. It was plain, besides, he had an
eye to the true interests of Mr. Harker; for though the
cart drew up more than once at the doors of public-houses, it
was only the sergeant who set foot to ground, and, being
equipped himself with a quart bottle, once more proceeded
on his rural drive.</p>

<p>To give any idea of the complexity of the sergeant&rsquo;s
course, a map of that part of Middlesex would be required,
and my publisher is averse from the expense. Suffice it,
that a little after the night had closed, the cart was brought
to a standstill in a woody road; where the sergeant lifted
from among the parcels, and tenderly deposited upon the
wayside, the inanimate form of Harker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come-to before daylight,&rdquo; thought the sergeant,
&ldquo;I shall be surprised for one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>From the various pockets of the slumbering carrier he
gently collected the sum of seventeen shillings and eightpence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page365"></a>365</span>
sterling; and, getting once more into the cart,
drove thoughtfully away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I was exactly sure of where I was, it would be a
good job,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Anyway, here&rsquo;s a corner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned it, and found himself upon the river-side. A
little above him the lights of a houseboat shone cheerfully;
and already close at hand, so close that it was impossible
to avoid their notice, three persons, a lady and two gentlemen,
were deliberately drawing near. The sergeant put
his trust in the convenient darkness of the night, and
drove on to meet them. One of the gentlemen, who was
of a portly figure, walked in the midst of the fairway, and
presently held up a staff by way of signal.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My man, have you seen anything of a carrier&rsquo;s cart?&rdquo;
he cried.</p>

<p>Dark as it was, it seemed to the sergeant as though the
slimmer of the two gentlemen had made a motion to prevent
the other speaking, and (finding himself too late) had
skipped aside with some alacrity. At another season,
Sergeant Brand would have paid more attention to the
fact; but he was then immersed in the perils of his own
predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A carrier&rsquo;s cart?&rdquo; said he, with a perceptible uncertainty
of voice. &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the portly gentleman, and stood aside
to let the sergeant pass. The lady appeared to bend
forward and study the cart with every mark of sharpened
curiosity, the slimmer gentleman still keeping in the rear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what the devil they would be at,&rdquo; thought
Sergeant Brand; and, looking fearfully back, he saw the
trio standing together in the midst of the way, like folk
consulting. The bravest of military heroes are not always
equal to themselves as to their reputation; and fear, on
some singular provocation, will find a lodgment in the most
unfamiliar bosom. The word &ldquo;detective&rdquo; might have
been heard to gurgle in the sergeant&rsquo;s throat; and vigorously
applying the whip, he fled up the river-side road to Great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page366"></a>366</span>
Haverham, at the gallop of the carrier&rsquo;s horse. The lights
of the houseboat flashed upon the flying waggon as it
passed; the beat of hoofs and the rattle of the vehicle
gradually coalesced and died away; and presently, to the
trio on the river-side, silence had redescended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most extraordinary thing,&rdquo; cried the slimmer
of the two gentlemen, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s the cart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I know I saw a piano,&rdquo; said the girl.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s the cart, certainly; and the extraordinary thing
is, it&rsquo;s not the man,&rdquo; added the first.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be the man, Gid, it must be,&rdquo; said the portly
one.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why is he running away?&rdquo; asked Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His horse bolted, I suppose,&rdquo; said the Squirradical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! I heard the whip going like a flail,&rdquo; said
Gideon. &ldquo;It simply defies the human reason.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; broke in the girl, &ldquo;he came round that
corner. Suppose we went and&mdash;what do you call it in
books?&mdash;followed his trail? There may be a house there,
or somebody who saw him, or something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose we did, for the fun of the thing,&rdquo; said
Gideon.</p>

<p>The fun of the thing (it would appear) consisted in the
extremely close juxtaposition of himself and Miss Hazeltine.
To Uncle Ned, who was excluded from these simple pleasures,
the excursion appeared hopeless from the first; and when
a fresh perspective of darkness opened up, dimly contained
between park palings on the one side and a hedge and
ditch upon the other, the whole without the smallest signal
of human habitation, the Squirradical drew up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a wild-goose chase,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>With the cessation of the footfalls, another sound smote
upon their ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; said Gideon.</p>

<p>The Squirradical had his stick presented like a sword.
&ldquo;Gid,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;Gid, I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page367"></a>367</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O Mr. Forsyth!&rdquo; cried the girl. &ldquo;O don&rsquo;t go forward,
you don&rsquo;t know what it might be&mdash;it might be something
perfectly horrid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be the devil itself,&rdquo; said Gideon, disengaging
himself, &ldquo;but I am going to see it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be rash, Gid,&rdquo; cried his uncle.</p>

<p>The barrister drew near to the sound, which was certainly
of a portentous character. In quality it appeared to blend
the strains of the cow, the fog-horn, and the mosquito; and
the startling manner of its enunciation added incalculably
to its terrors. A dark object, not unlike the human form
divine, appeared on the brink of the ditch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man,&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only a man; he seems
to be asleep and snoring.&mdash;Hullo,&rdquo; he added, a moment
after, &ldquo;there must be something wrong with him, he won&rsquo;t
waken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gideon produced his vestas, struck one, and by its light
recognised the tow head of Harker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the man,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as drunk as Belial. I
see the whole story&ldquo;; and to his two companions, who
had now ventured to rejoin him, he set forth a theory of
the divorce between the carrier and his cart, which was
not unlike the truth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drunken brute!&rdquo; said Uncle Ned, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get him to
a pump and give him what he deserves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;It is highly undesirable
he should see us together; and really, do you know, I am
very much obliged to him, for this is about the luckiest thing
that could have possibly occurred. It seems to me&mdash;Uncle
Ned, I declare to heaven it seems to me&mdash;I&rsquo;m clear of it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear of what?&rdquo; asked the Squirradical.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole affair!&rdquo; cried Gideon. &ldquo;That man has
been ass enough to steal the cart and the dead body;
what he hopes to do with it I neither know nor care. My
hands are free, Jimson ceases; down with Jimson. Shake
hands with me, Uncle Ned&mdash;Julia, darling girl, Julia,
I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>368</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Gideon, Gideon!&rdquo; said his uncle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, it&rsquo;s all right, uncle, when we&rsquo;re going to be
married so soon,&rdquo; said Gideon. &ldquo;You know you said
so yourself in the houseboat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did I?&rdquo; said Uncle Ned; &ldquo;I am certain I said no
such thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Appeal to him, tell him he did, get on his soft side,&rdquo;
cried Gideon. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real brick if you get on his soft
side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Bloomfield,&rdquo; said Julia, &ldquo;I know Gideon
will be such a very good boy, and he has promised me
to do such a lot of law, and I will see that he does too. And
you know it is so very steadying to young men, everybody
admits that; though, of course, I know I have no money,
Mr. Bloomfield,&rdquo; she added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady, as this rapscallion told you to-day
on the boat, Uncle Ned has plenty,&rdquo; said the Squirradical,
&ldquo;and I can never forget that you have been shamefully
defrauded. So as there&rsquo;s nobody looking, you had better
give your Uncle Ned a kiss. There, you rogue,&rdquo; resumed
Mr. Bloomfield, when the ceremony had been daintily performed,
&ldquo;this very pretty young lady is yours, and a vast
deal more than you deserve. But now, let us get back to
the houseboat, get up steam on the launch, and away back
to town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the thing!&rdquo; cried Gideon; &ldquo;and to-morrow
there will be no houseboat, and no Jimson, and no carrier&rsquo;s
cart, and no piano; and when Harker awakes on the ditch-side,
he may tell himself the whole affair has been a
dream.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said Uncle Ned, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s another man who
will have a different awakening. That fellow in the cart
will find he has been too clever by half.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Uncle Ned and Julia,&rdquo; said Gideon, &ldquo;I am as happy
as the King of Tartary, my heart is like a threepenny-bit,
my heels are like feathers; I am out of all my troubles,
Julia&rsquo;s hand is in mine. Is this a time for anything but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>369</span>
handsome sentiments? Why, there&rsquo;s not room in me for
anything that&rsquo;s not angelic! And when I think of that
poor unhappy devil in the cart, I stand here in the night
and cry with a single heart&mdash;God help him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Uncle Ned.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII</h3>

<h5>THE TRIBULATIONS OF MORRIS: PART THE SECOND</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">In</span> a really polite age of literature I would have scorned
to cast my eye again on the contortions of Morris. But
the study is in the spirit of the day; it presents, besides,
features of a high, almost a repulsive, morality; and if it
should prove the means of preventing any respectable and
inexperienced gentleman from plunging light-heartedly
into crime, even political crime, this work will not have
been penned in vain.</p>

<p>He rose on the morrow of his night with Michael, rose
from the leaden slumber of distress, to find his hand
tremulous, his eyes closed with rheum, his throat parched,
and his digestion obviously paralysed. &ldquo;Lord knows it&rsquo;s
not from eating!&rdquo; Morris thought; and as he dressed
he reconsidered his position under several heads. Nothing
will so well depict the troubled seas in which he was now
voyaging as a review of these various anxieties. I have
thrown them (for the reader&rsquo;s convenience) into a certain
order; but in the mind of one poor human equal they
whirled together like the dust of hurricanes. With the
same obliging preoccupation, I have put a name to each of
his distresses; and it will be observed with pity that every
individual item would have graced and commended the
cover of a railway novel.</p>

<p>Anxiety the First: <i>Where is the Body? or, The Mystery
of Bent Pitman.</i> It was now manifestly plain that Bent
Pitman (as was to be looked for from his ominous appellation)
belonged to the darker order of the criminal class.
An honest man would not have cashed the bill; a humane
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page371"></a>371</span>
man would not have accepted in silence the tragic contents
of the water-butt; a man, who was not already up to the
hilts in gore, would have lacked the means of secretly disposing
them. This process of reasoning left a horrid image
of the monster, Pitman. Doubtless he had long ago disposed
of the body&mdash;dropping it through a trap-door in
his back kitchen, Morris supposed, with some hazy recollection
of a picture in a penny dreadful; and doubtless
the man now lived in wanton splendour on the proceeds of
the bill. So far, all was peace. But with the profligate
habits of a man like Bent Pitman (who was no doubt a
hunchback in the bargain), eight hundred pounds could be
easily melted in a week. When they were gone, what
would he be likely to do next? A hell-like voice in
Morris&rsquo;s own bosom gave the answer: &ldquo;Blackmail me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anxiety the Second: <i>The Fraud of the Tontine; or,
Is my Uncle dead?</i> This, on which all Morris&rsquo;s hopes
depended, was yet a question. He had tried to bully
Teena; he had tried to bribe her; and nothing came of
it. He had his moral conviction still; but you cannot
blackmail a sharp lawyer on a moral conviction. And
besides, since his interview with Michael, the idea wore a
less attractive countenance. Was Michael the man to be
blackmailed? and was Morris the man to do it? Grave
considerations. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m afraid of him,&rdquo; Morris so
far condescended to reassure himself; &ldquo;but I must be very
certain of my ground, and the deuce of it is, I see no way.
How unlike is life to novels! I wouldn&rsquo;t have even begun
this business in a novel, but what I&rsquo;d have met a dark,
slouching fellow in the Oxford Road, who&rsquo;d have become
my accomplice, and known all about how to do it, and
probably broken into Michael&rsquo;s house at night and found
nothing but a waxwork image; and then blackmailed or
murdered me. But here, in real life, I might walk the
streets till I dropped dead, and none of the criminal classes
would look near me. Though, to be sure, there is always
Pitman,&rdquo; he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>372</span></p>

<p>Anxiety the Third: <i>The Cottage at Browndean; or,
The Underpaid Accomplice.</i> For he had an accomplice,
and that accomplice was blooming unseen in a damp
cottage in Hampshire with empty pockets. What could
be done about that? He really ought to have sent him
something; if it was only a post-office order for five bob,
enough to prove that he was kept in mind, enough to keep
him in hope, beer, and tobacco. &ldquo;But what would you
have?&rdquo; thought Morris; and ruefully poured into his
hand a half-crown, a florin, and eightpence in small change.
For a man in Morris&rsquo;s position, at war with all society, and
conducting, with the hand of inexperience, a widely ramified
intrigue, the sum was already a derision. John would
have to be doing; no mistake of that. &ldquo;But then,&rdquo;
asked the hell-like voice, &ldquo;how long is John likely to
stand it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Anxiety the Fourth: <i>The Leather Business; or, The
Shutters at Last: a Tale of the City.</i> On this head Morris
had no news. He had not yet dared to visit the family
concern; yet he knew he must delay no longer, and if anything
had been wanted to sharpen this conviction, Michael&rsquo;s
references of the night before rang ambiguously in his ear.
Well and good. To visit the city might be indispensable;
but what was he to do when he was there? He had no
right to sign in his own name; and, with all the will in the
world, he seemed to lack the art of signing with his uncle&rsquo;s.
Under these circumstances, Morris could do nothing to
procrastinate the crash; and, when it came, when prying
eyes began to be applied to every joint of his behaviour, two
questions could not fail to be addressed, sooner or later,
to a speechless and perspiring insolvent. Where is Mr.
Joseph Finsbury? and how about your visit to the bank?
Questions, how easy to put!&mdash;ye gods, how impossible to
answer! The man to whom they should be addressed
went certainly to gaol, and&mdash;eh! what was this?&mdash;possibly
to the gallows. Morris was trying to shave when this
idea struck him, and he laid the razor down. Here (in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page373"></a>373</span>
Michael&rsquo;s words) was the total disappearance of a valuable
uncle; here was a time of inexplicable conduct on the part
of a nephew who had been in bad blood with the old man
any time these seven years; what a chance for a judicial
blunder! &ldquo;But no,&rdquo; thought Morris, &ldquo;they cannot, they
dare not, make it murder. Not that. But honestly, and
speaking as a man to a man, I don&rsquo;t see any other crime
in the calendar (except arson) that I don&rsquo;t seem somehow
to have committed. And yet I&rsquo;m a perfectly respectable
man, and wished nothing but my due. Law is a pretty
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With this conclusion firmly seated in his mind, Morris
Finsbury descended to the hall of the house in John Street,
still half-shaven. There was a letter in the box; he
knew the handwriting: John at last!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I think I might have been spared this,&rdquo; he said
bitterly, and tore it open.</p>

<div class="quote">
<p>&ldquo;Dear Morris,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;what the dickens do you mean by it?
I&rsquo;m in an awful hole down here; I have to go on tick, and the
parties on the spot don&rsquo;t cotton to the idea; they couldn&rsquo;t, because
it is so plain I&rsquo;m in a stait of Destitution. I&rsquo;ve got no bed-clothes,
think of that, I must have coins, the hole thing&rsquo;s a Mockry, I wont
stand it, nobody would. I would have come away before, only I
have no money for the railway fare. Don&rsquo;t be a lunatic, Morris,
you don&rsquo;t seem to understand my dredful situation. I have to get
the stamp on tick. A fact.&mdash;Ever your affte. Brother,</p>

<p class="sc rt">&ldquo;J. Finsbury.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t even spell!&rdquo; Morris reflected, as he crammed
the letter in his pocket, and left the house. &ldquo;What can
I do for him? I have to go to the expense of a barber,
I&rsquo;m so shattered! How can I send anybody coins? It&rsquo;s
hard lines, I daresay; but does he think I&rsquo;m living on hot
muffins? One comfort,&rdquo; was his grim reflection, &ldquo;he
can&rsquo;t cut and run&mdash;he&rsquo;s got to stay; he&rsquo;s as helpless as the
dead.&rdquo; And then he broke forth again: &ldquo;Complains,
does he? and he&rsquo;s never even heard of Bent Pitman! If
he had what I have on my mind, he might complain
with a good grace.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"></a>374</span></p>

<p>But these were not honest arguments, or not wholly
honest; there was a struggle in the mind of Morris; he
could not disguise from himself that his brother John was
miserably situated at Browndean, without news, without
money, without bed-clothes, without society or any entertainment;
and by the time he had been shaved and picked
a hasty breakfast at a coffee tavern, Morris had arrived
at a compromise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Johnny,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s in an awful
box! I can&rsquo;t send him coins, but I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do:
I&rsquo;ll send him the <i>Pink Un</i>&mdash;it&rsquo;ll cheer John up; and besides,
it&rsquo;ll do his credit good getting anything by post.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Accordingly, on his way to the leather business, whither
he proceeded (according to his thrifty habit) on foot,
Morris purchased and despatched a single copy of that
enlivening periodical, to which (in a sudden pang of remorse)
he added at random the <i>Athen√¶um</i>, the <i>Revivalist</i>,
and the <i>Penny Pictorial Weekly</i>. So there was John set
up with literature, and Morris had laid balm upon his
conscience.</p>

<p>As if to reward him, he was received in his place of
business with good news. Orders were pouring in; there
was a run on some of the back stock, and the figure had
gone up. Even the manager appeared elated. As for Morris,
who had almost forgotten the meaning of good news, he
longed to sob like a little child; he could have caught the
manager (a pallid man with startled eyebrows) to his bosom;
he could have found it in his generosity to give a cheque
(for a small sum) to every clerk in the counting-house. As
he sat and opened his letters a chorus of airy vocalists sang
in his brain, to most exquisite music, &ldquo;This whole concern
may be profitable yet, profitable yet, profitable yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To him, in this sunny moment of relief, enter a Mr.
Rodgerson, a creditor, but not one who was expected to be
pressing, for his connection with the firm was old and
regular.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Finsbury,&rdquo; said he, not without embarrassment,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>375</span>
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s of course only fair to let you know&mdash;the fact is, money
is a trifle tight&mdash;I have some paper out&mdash;for that matter,
every one&rsquo;s complaining&mdash;and in short&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It has never been our habit, Rodgerson,&rdquo; said Morris,
turning pale. &ldquo;But give me time to turn round, and I&rsquo;ll
see what I can do; I daresay we can let you have something
to account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just where it is,&rdquo; replied Rodgerson.
&ldquo;I was tempted; I&rsquo;ve let the credit out of my hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Out of your hands?&rdquo; repeated Morris. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
playing rather fast and loose with us, Mr. Rodgerson.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I got cent. for cent. for it,&rdquo; said the other,
&ldquo;on the nail, in a certified cheque.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cent. for cent.!&rdquo;  cried Morris. &ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s
something like thirty per cent. bonus; a singular thing!
Who&rsquo;s the party?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know the man,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Name of
Moss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Jew,&rdquo; Morris reflected, when his visitor was gone.
And what could a Jew want with a claim of&mdash;he verified
the amount in the books&mdash;a claim of three five eight,
nineteen, ten, against the house of Finsbury? And why
should he pay cent. for cent.? The figure proved the
loyalty of Rodgerson&mdash;even Morris admitted that. But
it proved unfortunately something else&mdash;the eagerness of
Moss. The claim must have been wanted instantly, for that
day, for that morning even. Why? The mystery of Moss
promised to be a fit pendant to the mystery of Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And just when all was looking well too!&rdquo; cried Morris,
smiting his hand upon the desk. And almost at the same
moment Mr. Moss was announced.</p>

<p>Mr. Moss was a radiant Hebrew, brutally handsome, and
offensively polite. He was acting, it appeared, for a third
party; he understood nothing of the circumstances; his
client desired to have his position regularised; but he
would accept an antedated cheque&mdash;antedated by two
months, if Mr. Finsbury chose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page376"></a>376</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand this,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;What
made you pay cent. per cent. for it to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Moss had no idea; only his orders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole thing is thoroughly irregular,&rdquo; said Morris.
&ldquo;It is not the custom of the trade to settle at this time
of the year. What are your instructions if I refuse?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am to see Mr. Joseph Finsbury, the head of the
firm,&rdquo; said Mr. Moss. &ldquo;I was directed to insist on that;
it was implied you had no status here&mdash;the expressions
are not mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You cannot see Mr. Joseph; he is unwell,&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case I was to place the matter in the hands of a
lawyer. Let me see,&rdquo; said Mr. Moss, opening a pocket-book
with, perhaps, suspicious care, at the right place&mdash;&ldquo;Yes&mdash;of
Mr. Michael Finsbury. A relation, perhaps? In that
case, I presume, the matter will be pleasantly arranged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To pass into the hands of Michael was too much for
Morris. He struck his colours. A cheque at two months
was nothing, after all. In two months he would probably
be dead, or in a gaol at any rate. He bade the manager
give Mr. Moss a chair and the paper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going over to
get a cheque signed by Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who is
lying ill at John Street.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A cab there and a cab back; here were inroads on his
wretched capital! He counted the cost; when he was
done with Mr. Moss he would be left with twelvepence-halfpenny
in the world. What was even worse, he had now
been forced to bring his uncle up to Bloomsbury. &ldquo;No
use for poor Johnny in Hampshire now,&rdquo; he reflected.
&ldquo;And how the farce is to be kept up completely passes me.
At Browndean it was just possible; in Bloomsbury it
seems beyond human ingenuity&mdash;though I suppose it&rsquo;s
what Michael does. But then he has accomplices&mdash;that
Scotsman and the whole gang. Ah, if I had accomplices!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Necessity is the mother of the arts. Under a spur so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page377"></a>377</span>
immediate, Morris surprised himself by the neatness and
despatch of his new forgery, and within three-fourths of an
hour had handed it to Mr. Moss.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is very satisfactory,&rdquo; observed that gentleman,
rising. &ldquo;I was to tell you it will not be presented, but
you had better take care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room swam round Morris. &ldquo;What&mdash;what&rsquo;s that!&rdquo;
he cried, grasping the table. He was miserably conscious
the next moment of his shrill tongue and ashen face. &ldquo;What
do you mean&mdash;it will not be presented? Why am I to
take care? What is all this mummery?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no idea, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; replied the smiling
Hebrew. &ldquo;It was a message I was to deliver. The expressions
were put into my mouth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is your client&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; asked Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a secret for the moment,&rdquo; answered Mr. Moss.</p>

<p>Morris bent toward him. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the bank?&rdquo; he
asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no authority to say more, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo;
returned Mr. Moss. &ldquo;I will wish you a good morning, if
you please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wish me a good morning!&rdquo; thought Morris; and
the next moment, seizing his hat, he fled from his place of
business like a madman. Three streets away he stopped
and groaned. &ldquo;Lord! I should have borrowed from the
manager!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s too late now; it would
look dicky to go back; I&rsquo;m penniless&mdash;simply penniless&mdash;like
the unemployed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went home and sat in the dismantled dining-room
with his head in his hands. Newton never thought harder
than this victim of circumstances, and yet no clearness
came. &ldquo;It may be a defect in my intelligence,&rdquo; he cried,
rising to his feet, &ldquo;but I cannot see that I am fairly used.
The bad luck I&rsquo;ve had is a thing to write to the <i>Times</i>
about; it&rsquo;s enough to breed a revolution. And the plain
English of the whole thing is that I must have money at once.
I&rsquo;m done with all morality now; I&rsquo;m long past that stage;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page378"></a>378</span>
money I must have, and the only chance I see is Bent
Pitman. Bent Pitman is a criminal, and therefore his
position&rsquo;s weak. He must have some of that eight hundred
left; if he has I&rsquo;ll force him to go shares; and even if he
hasn&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;ll tell him the tontine affair, and with a desperate
man like Pitman at my back, it&rsquo;ll be strange if I don&rsquo;t
succeed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Well and good. But how to lay hands upon Bent Pitman,
except by advertisement, was not so clear. And
even so, in what terms to ask a meeting? on what grounds?
and where? Not at John Street, for it would never do to
let a man like Bent Pitman know your real address; nor
yet at Pitman&rsquo;s house, some dreadful place in Holloway,
with a trap-door in the back kitchen; a house which you
might enter in a light summer overcoat and varnished
boots, to come forth again piecemeal in a market-basket.
That was the drawback of a really efficient accomplice,
Morris felt, not without a shudder. &ldquo;I never dreamed I
should come to actually covet such society,&rdquo; he thought.
And then a brilliant idea struck him. Waterloo Station,
a public place, yet at certain hours of the day a solitary;
a place, besides, the very name of which must knock upon
the heart of Pitman, and at once suggest a knowledge of
the latest of his guilty secrets. Morris took a piece of
paper and sketched his advertisement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">William Bent Pitman</span>, if this should meet the eye
of, he will hear of <span class="sc">SOMETHING TO HIS ADVANTAGE</span> on the far
end of the main line departure platform, Waterloo Station,
2 to 4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span>, Sunday next.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris reperused this literary trifle with approbation.
&ldquo;Terse,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;Something to his advantage is
not strictly true; but it&rsquo;s taking and original, and a man
is not on oath in an advertisement. All that I require
now is the ready cash for my own meals and for the advertisement,
and&mdash;no, I can&rsquo;t lavish money upon John,
but I&rsquo;ll give him some more papers. How to raise the
wind?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page379"></a>379</span></p>

<p>He approached his cabinet of signets, and the collector
suddenly revolted in his blood. &ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;nothing shall induce me to massacre my collection&mdash;rather
theft!&rdquo; And dashing upstairs to the drawing-room,
he helped himself to a few of his uncle&rsquo;s curiosities:
a pair of Turkish babooshes, a Smyrna fan, a water-cooler,
a musket guaranteed to have been seized from an Ephesian
bandit, and a pocketful of curious but incomplete sea-shells.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIV</h3>

<h5>WILLIAM BENT PITMAN HEARS OF SOMETHING
TO HIS ADVANTAGE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">On</span> the morning of Sunday, William Dent Pitman rose
at his usual hour, although with something more than the
usual reluctance. The day before (it should be explained)
an addition had been made to his family in the person of a
lodger. Michael Finsbury had acted sponsor in the business,
and guaranteed the weekly bill; on the other hand, no
doubt with a spice of his prevailing jocularity, he had
drawn a depressing portrait of the lodger&rsquo;s character.
Mr. Pitman had been led to understand his guest was not
good company; he had approached the gentleman with
fear, and had rejoiced to find himself the entertainer of an
angel. At tea he had been vastly pleased; till hard on
one in the morning he had sat entranced by eloquence and
progressively fortified with information in the studio; and
now, as he reviewed over his toilet the harmless pleasures
of the evening, the future smiled upon him with revived
attractions. &ldquo;Mr. Finsbury is indeed an acquisition,&rdquo; he
remarked to himself; and as he entered the little parlour,
where the table was already laid for breakfast, the cordiality
of his greeting would have befitted an acquaintanceship
already old.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to see you, sir&rdquo;&mdash;these were his expressions&mdash;&ldquo;and
I trust you have slept well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accustomed as I have been for so long to a life of
almost perpetual change,&rdquo; replied the guest, &ldquo;the disturbance
so often complained of by the more sedentary,
as attending their first night in (what is called) a new bed,
is a complaint from which I am entirely free.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page381"></a>381</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to hear it,&rdquo; said the drawing-master
warmly. &ldquo;But I see I have interrupted you over the
paper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Sunday paper is one of the features of the age,&rdquo;
said Mr. Finsbury. &ldquo;In America, I am told, it supersedes
all other literature, the bone and sinew of the nation
finding their requirements catered for; hundreds of columns
will be occupied with interesting details of the world&rsquo;s
doings, such as water-spouts, elopements, conflagrations,
and public entertainments; there is a corner for politics,
ladies&rsquo; work, chess, religion, and even literature; and a
few spicy editorials serve to direct the course of public
thought. It is difficult to estimate the part played by
such enormous and miscellaneous repositories in the
education of the people. But this (though interesting in
itself) partakes of the nature of a digression; and what I
was about to ask you was this: Are you yourself a student
of the daily press?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is not much in the papers to interest an artist,&rdquo;
returned Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; resumed Joseph, &ldquo;an advertisement
which has appeared the last two days in various journals,
and reappears this morning, may possibly have failed to
catch your eye. The name, with a trifling variation, bears
a strong resemblance to your own. Ah, here it is. If you
please, I will read it to you:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;<span class="sc">William Bent Pitman</span>, if this should meet the eye
of, he will hear of <span class="sc">SOMETHING TO HIS ADVANTAGE</span> at the
far end of the main line departure platform, Waterloo
Station, 2 to 4 <span class="sc">P.M.</span> to-day.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that in print?&rdquo; cried Pitman. &ldquo;Let me see it!
Bent? It must be Dent! <i>Something to my advantage?</i>
Mr. Finsbury, excuse me offering a word of caution; I
am aware how strangely this must sound in your ears,
but there are domestic reasons why this little circumstance
might perhaps be better kept between ourselves. Mrs.
Pitman&mdash;my dear sir, I assure you there is nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"></a>382</span>
dishonourable in my secrecy; the reasons are domestic,
merely domestic; and I may set your conscience at rest
when I assure you all the circumstances are known to our
common friend, your excellent nephew, Mr. Michael, who
has not withdrawn from me his esteem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A word is enough, Mr. Pitman,&rdquo; said Joseph, with
one of his Oriental reverences.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, the drawing-master found Michael
in bed and reading a book, the picture of good-humour
and repose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hillo, Pitman,&rdquo; he said, laying down his book, &ldquo;what
brings you here at this inclement hour? Ought to be in
church, my boy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have little thought of church to-day, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo;
said the drawing-master. &ldquo;I am on the brink of something
new, sir.&rdquo; And he presented the advertisement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, what is this?&rdquo; cried Michael, sitting suddenly
up. He studied it for half a minute with a frown. &ldquo;Pitman,
I don&rsquo;t care about this document a particle,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will have to be attended to, however,&rdquo; said Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you&rsquo;d had enough of Waterloo,&rdquo; returned
the lawyer. &ldquo;Have you started a morbid craving? You&rsquo;ve
never been yourself anyway since you lost that beard. I
believe now it was where you kept your senses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; said the drawing-master, &ldquo;I have
tried to reason this matter but, and, with your permission,
I should like to lay before you the results.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire away,&rdquo; said Michael; &ldquo;but please, Pitman,
remember it&rsquo;s Sunday, and let&rsquo;s have no bad language.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are three views open to us,&rdquo; began Pitman.
&ldquo;First this may be connected with the barrel; second, it
may be connected with Mr. Semitopolis&rsquo;s statue; and
third, it may be from my wife&rsquo;s brother, who went to
Australia. In the first case, which is of course possible,
I confess the matter would be best allowed to drop.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The court is with you there, Brother Pitman,&rdquo; said
Michael.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page383"></a>383</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;In the second,&rdquo; continued the other, &ldquo;it is plainly
my duty to leave no stone unturned for the recovery of
the lost antique.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, Semitopolis has come down like a
trump; he has pocketed the loss and left you the profit.
What more would you have?&rdquo; inquired the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I conceive, sir, under correction, that Mr. Semitopolis&rsquo;s
generosity binds me to even greater exertion,&rdquo;
said the drawing-master. &ldquo;The whole business was unfortunate;
it was&mdash;I need not disguise it from you&mdash;it
was illegal from the first: the more reason that I should
try to behave like a gentleman,&rdquo; concluded Pitman,
flushing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have nothing to say to that,&rdquo; returned the lawyer.
&ldquo;I have sometimes thought I should like to try to behave
like a gentleman myself; only it&rsquo;s such a one-sided business,
with the world and the legal profession as they are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, in the third,&rdquo; resumed the drawing-master,
&ldquo;if it&rsquo;s Uncle Tim, of course, our fortune&rsquo;s made.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not Uncle Tim, though,&rdquo; said the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you observed that very remarkable expression:
<i>Something to his advantage</i>?&rdquo; inquired Pitman shrewdly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You innocent mutton,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the seediest
commonplace in the English language, and only proves the
advertiser is an ass. Let me demolish your house of cards
for you at once. Would Uncle Tim make that blunder in
your name?&mdash;in itself, the blunder is delicious, a huge
improvement on the gross reality, and I mean to adopt it
in the future; but is it like Uncle Tim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not like him,&rdquo; Pitman admitted. &ldquo;But his
mind may have become unhinged at Ballarat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come to that, Pitman,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;the
advertiser <i>may</i> be Queen Victoria, fired with the desire to
make a duke of you. I put it to yourself if that&rsquo;s probable;
and yet it&rsquo;s not against the laws of nature. But we sit
here to consider probabilities; and with your genteel
permission, I eliminate her Majesty and Uncle Tim on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page384"></a>384</span>
the threshold. To proceed, we have your second idea, that
this has some connection with the statue. Possible;
but in that case who is the advertiser? Not Ricardi,
for he knows your address; not the person who got the
box, for he doesn&rsquo;t know your name. The vanman, I hear
you suggest, in a lucid interval. He might have got your
name, and got it incorrectly, at the station; and he might
have failed to get your address. I grant the vanman.
But a question: Do you really wish to meet the vanman?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I not?&rdquo; asked Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he wants to meet you,&rdquo; replied Michael, &ldquo;observe
this: it is because he has found his address-book, has
been to the house that got the statue, and&mdash;mark my
words!&mdash;is moving at the instigation of the murderer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry to think so,&rdquo; said Pitman;
&ldquo;but I still consider it my duty to Mr. Semitopolis....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pitman,&rdquo; interrupted Michael, &ldquo;this will not do.
Don&rsquo;t seek to impose on your legal adviser; don&rsquo;t try to
pass yourself off for the Duke of Wellington, for that is
not your line. Come, I wager a dinner I can read your
thoughts. You still believe it&rsquo;s Uncle Tim.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; said the drawing-master, colouring,
&ldquo;you are not a man in narrow circumstances, and you have
no family. Guendolen is growing up, a very promising
girl&mdash;she was confirmed this year; and I think you will
be able to enter into my feelings as a parent when I tell
you she is quite ignorant of dancing. The boys are at
the board school, which is all very well in its way; at
least, I am the last man in the world to criticise the institutions
of my native land. But I had fondly hoped that
Harold might become a professional musician; and little
Otho shows a quite remarkable vocation for the Church. I
am not exactly an ambitious man....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; interrupted Michael. &ldquo;Be explicit;
you think it&rsquo;s Uncle Tim?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It might be Uncle Tim,&rdquo; insisted Pitman, &ldquo;and if
it were, and I neglected the occasion, how could I ever look
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page385"></a>385</span>
my children in the face? I do not refer to Mrs.
Pitman....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you never do,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... but in the case of her own brother returning
from Ballarat ...&rdquo; continued Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... with his mind unhinged,&rdquo; put in the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;... returning from Ballarat with a large fortune,
her impatience may be more easily imagined than described,&rdquo;
concluded Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;be it so. And what do
you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to Waterloo,&rdquo; said Pitman, &ldquo;in disguise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All by your little self?&rdquo; inquired the lawyer. &ldquo;Well,
I hope you think it safe. Mind and send me word from
the police cells.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, Mr. Finsbury, I had ventured to hope&mdash;perhaps
you might be induced to&mdash;to make one of us,&rdquo; faltered
Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Disguise myself on Sunday?&rdquo; cried Michael. &ldquo;How
little you understand my principles!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Finsbury, I have no means of showing you my
gratitude; but let me ask you one question,&rdquo; said Pitman.
&ldquo;If I were a very rich client, would you not take the
risk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Diamond, Diamond, you know not what you do!&rdquo;
cried Michael. &ldquo;Why, man, do you suppose I make a
practice of cutting about London with my clients in disguise?
Do you suppose money would induce me to touch
this business with a stick? I give you my word of honour,
it would not. But I own I have a real curiosity to see how
you conduct this interview&mdash;that tempts me; it tempts me,
Pitman, more than gold&mdash;it should be exquisitely rich.&rdquo;
And suddenly Michael laughed. &ldquo;Well, Pitman,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;have all the truck ready in the studio. I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>About twenty minutes after two, on this eventful day,
the vast and gloomy shed of Waterloo lay, like the temple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page386"></a>386</span>
of a dead religion, silent and deserted. Here and there
at one of the platforms, a train lay becalmed; here and
there a wandering footfall echoed; the cab-horses outside
stamped with startling reverberations on the stones; or
from the neighbouring wilderness of railway an engine
snorted forth a whistle. The main-line departure platform
slumbered like the rest; the booking-hutches closed; the
backs of Mr. Haggard&rsquo;s novels, with which upon a weekday
the bookstall shines emblazoned, discreetly hidden
behind dingy shutters; the rare officials, undisguisedly
somnambulant; and the customary loiterers, even to the
middle-aged woman with the ulster and the handbag, fled
to more congenial scenes. As in the inmost dells of some
small tropic island the throbbing of the ocean lingers, so
here a faint pervading hum and trepidation told in every
corner of surrounding London.</p>

<p>At the hour already named, persons acquainted with
John Dickson, of Ballarat, and Ezra Thomas, of the United
States of America, would have been cheered to behold
them enter through the booking-office.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What names are we to take?&rdquo; inquired the latter,
anxiously adjusting the window-glass spectacles which he
had been suffered on this occasion to assume.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no choice for you, my boy,&rdquo; returned Michael.
&ldquo;Bent Pitman or nothing. As for me, I think I look as
if I might be called Appleby; something agreeably old-world
about Appleby&mdash;breathes of Devonshire cider.
Talking of which, suppose you wet your whistle? the
interview is likely to be trying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll wait till afterwards,&rdquo; returned Pitman;
&ldquo;on the whole, I think I&rsquo;ll wait till the thing&rsquo;s over. I
don&rsquo;t know if it strikes you as it does me; but the place
seems deserted and silent, Mr. Finsbury, and filled with very
singular echoes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kind of Jack-in-the-box feeling?&rdquo; inquired Michael,
&ldquo;as if all these empty trains might be filled with policemen
waiting for a signal? and Sir Charles Warren perched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page387"></a>387</span>
among the girders with a silver whistle to his lips? It&rsquo;s
guilt, Pitman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In this uneasy frame of mind they walked nearly the
whole length of the departure platform, and at the western
extremity became aware of a slender figure standing back
against a pillar. The figure was plainly sunk into a deep
abstraction; he was not aware of their approach, but
gazed far abroad over the sunlit station. Michael stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Holloa!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can that be your advertiser?
If so, I&rsquo;m done with it.&rdquo; And then, on second thoughts:
&ldquo;Not so, either,&rdquo; he resumed more cheerfully. &ldquo;Here,
turn your back a moment. So. Give me the specs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you agreed I was to have them,&rdquo; protested
Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but that man knows me,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he? what&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo; cried Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, he took me into his confidence,&rdquo; returned the
lawyer. &ldquo;But I may say one thing: if he&rsquo;s your advertiser
(and he may be, for he seems to have been seized with
criminal lunacy) you can go ahead with a clear conscience,
for I hold him in the hollow of my hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The change effected, and Pitman comforted with this
good news, the pair drew near to Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you looking for Mr. William Bent Pitman?&rdquo;
inquired the drawing-master. &ldquo;I am he.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris raised his head. He saw before him, in the
speaker, a person of almost indescribable insignificance,
in white spats and a shirt cut indecently low. A little
behind, a second and more burly figure offered little to
criticism, except ulster, whiskers, spectacles, and deer-stalker
hat. Since he had decided to call up devils from
the underworld of London, Morris had pondered deeply
on the probabilities of their appearance. His first emotion,
like that of Charoba when she beheld the sea, was one of
disappointment; his second did more justice to the case.
Never before had he seen a couple dressed like these; he
had struck a new stratum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page388"></a>388</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I must speak with you alone,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You need not mind Mr. Appleby,&rdquo; returned Pitman.
&ldquo;He knows all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All? Do you know what I am here to speak of?&rdquo;
inquired Morris. &ldquo;The barrel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pitman turned pale, but it was with manly indignation.
&ldquo;You are the man!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You very wicked
person.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I to speak before him?&rdquo; asked Morris, disregarding
these severe expressions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has been present throughout,&rdquo; said Pitman.
&ldquo;He opened the barrel; your guilty secret is already
known to him, as well as to your Maker and myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Morris, &ldquo;what have you done with
the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about any money,&rdquo; said Pitman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t try that on,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;I have
tracked you down; you came to the station sacrilegiously
disguised as a clergyman, procured my barrel, opened it,
rifled the body, and cashed the bill. I have been to the
bank, I tell you! I have followed you step by step, and
your denials are childish and absurd.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Morris, keep your temper,&rdquo; said Mr.
Appleby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael!&rdquo; cried Morris, &ldquo;Michael here too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here too,&rdquo; echoed the lawyer; &ldquo;here and everywhere,
my good fellow; every step you take is counted;
trained detectives follow you like your shadow; they
report to me every three-quarters of an hour; no expense
is spared.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris&rsquo;s face took on a hue of dirty grey. &ldquo;Well, I
don&rsquo;t care; I have the less reserve to keep,&rdquo; he cried.
&ldquo;That man cashed my bill; it&rsquo;s a theft, and I want the
money back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think I would lie to you, Morris?&rdquo; asked
Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said his cousin. &ldquo;I want my money.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page389"></a>389</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It was I alone who touched the body,&rdquo; began Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You? Michael!&rdquo; cried Morris, starting back.
&ldquo;Then why haven&rsquo;t you declared the death?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; asked Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I mad? or are you?&rdquo; cried Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it must be Pitman,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>The three men stared at each other, wild-eyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is dreadful,&rdquo; said Morris, &ldquo;dreadful. I do not
understand one word that is addressed to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give you my word of honour, no more do I,&rdquo; said
Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in God&rsquo;s name, why whiskers?&rdquo; cried Morris,
pointing in a ghastly manner at his cousin. &ldquo;Does my
brain reel? How whiskers?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, that&rsquo;s a matter of detail,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>There was another silence, during which Morris appeared
to himself to be shot in a trapeze as high as St. Paul&rsquo;s, and
as low as Baker Street Station.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let us recapitulate,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;unless it&rsquo;s really
a dream, in which case I wish Teena would call me for
breakfast. My friend Pitman, here, received a barrel
which, it now appears, was meant for you. The barrel
contained the body of a man. How or why you killed
him....&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never laid a hand on him,&rdquo; protested Morris. &ldquo;This
is what I have dreaded all along. But think, Michael!
I&rsquo;m not that kind of man; with all my faults, I wouldn&rsquo;t
touch a hair of anybody&rsquo;s head, and it was all dead loss
to me. He got killed in that vile accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly Michael was seized by mirth so prolonged and
excessive that his companions supposed beyond a doubt
his reason had deserted him. Again and again he struggled
to compose himself, and again and again laughter overwhelmed
him like a tide. In all this maddening interview
there had been no more spectral feature than this of Michael&rsquo;s
merriment; and Pitman and Morris, drawn together by the
common fear, exchanged glances of anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page390"></a>390</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Morris,&rdquo; gasped the lawyer, when he was at last able
to articulate, &ldquo;hold on, I see it all now. I can make it
clear in one word. Here&rsquo;s the key: <i>I never guessed it
was Uncle Joseph till this moment.</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark produced an instant lightening of the
tension for Morris. For Pitman it quenched the last ray
of hope and daylight. Uncle Joseph, whom he had left
an hour ago in Norfolk Street, pasting newspaper cuttings?&mdash;it?&mdash;the
dead body?&mdash;then who was he, Pitman? and
was this Waterloo Station or Colney Hatch?</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; cried Morris; &ldquo;it was badly smashed,
I know. How stupid not to think of that! Why, then,
all&rsquo;s clear; and, my dear Michael, I&rsquo;ll tell you what&mdash;we&rsquo;re
saved, both saved. You get the tontine&mdash;I don&rsquo;t
grudge it you the least&mdash;and I get the leather business,
which is really beginning to look up. Declare the death
at once, don&rsquo;t mind me in the smallest, don&rsquo;t consider
me; declare the death, and we&rsquo;re all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, but I can&rsquo;t declare it,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; cried Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t produce the corpus, Morris. I&rsquo;ve lost it,&rdquo; said
the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; ejaculated the leather merchant. &ldquo;How
is this? It&rsquo;s not possible. I lost it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve lost it too, my son,&rdquo; said Michael, with
extreme serenity. &ldquo;Not recognising it, you see, and suspecting
something irregular in its origin, I got rid of&mdash;what
shall we say?&mdash;got rid of the proceeds at once.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You got rid of the body? What made you do
that?&rdquo; wailed Morris. &ldquo;But you can get it again? You
know where it is?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I did, Morris, and you may believe me there,
for it would be a small sum in my pocket; but the fact is,
I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good Lord,&rdquo; said Morris, addressing heaven and earth,
&ldquo;good Lord, I&rsquo;ve lost the leather business!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael was once more shaken with laughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page391"></a>391</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you laugh, you fool?&rdquo; cried his cousin,
&ldquo;you lose more than I. You&rsquo;ve bungled it worse than
even I did. If you had a spark of feeling, you would be
shaking in your boots with vexation. But I&rsquo;ll tell you
one thing&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have that eight hundred pound&mdash;I&rsquo;ll have
that and go to Swan River&mdash;that&rsquo;s mine, anyway, and your
friend must have forged to cash it. Give me the eight
hundred, here, upon this platform, or I go straight to
Scotland Yard and turn the whole disreputable story
inside out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morris,&rdquo; said Michael, laying his hand upon his
shoulder, &ldquo;hear reason. It wasn&rsquo;t us, it was the other
man. We never even searched the body.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other man?&rdquo; repeated Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the other man. We palmed Uncle Joseph off
upon another man,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You what? You palmed him off? That&rsquo;s surely
a singular expression,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, palmed him off for a piano,&rdquo; said Michael with
perfect simplicity. &ldquo;Remarkably full, rich tone,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>Morris carried his hand to his brow and looked at it;
it was wet with sweat. &ldquo;Fever,&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was a Broadwood grand,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;Pitman
here will tell you if it was genuine or not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eh? O! O yes, I believe it was a genuine Broadwood;
I have played upon it several times myself,&rdquo; said
Pitman. &ldquo;The three-letter E was broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say anything more about pianos,&rdquo; said Morris,
with a strong shudder; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not the man I used to be!
This&mdash;this other man&mdash;let&rsquo;s come to him, if I can only
manage to follow. Who is he? Where can I get hold of
him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the rub,&rdquo; said Michael. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been in
possession of the desired article, let me see&mdash;since Wednesday,
about four o&rsquo;clock, and is now, I should imagine, on
his way to the isles of Javan and Gadire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael,&rdquo; said Morris pleadingly, &ldquo;I am in a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page392"></a>392</span>
weak state, and I beg your consideration for a kinsman.
Say it slowly again, and be sure you are correct. When
did he get it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael repeated his statement.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s the worst thing yet,&rdquo; said Morris, drawing
in his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked the lawyer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even the dates are sheer nonsense,&rdquo; said the leather
merchant. &ldquo;The bill was cashed on Tuesday. There&rsquo;s
not a gleam of reason in the whole transaction.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young gentleman, who had passed the trio and
suddenly started and turned back, at this moment laid a
heavy hand on Michael&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aha! so this is Mr. Dickson?&rdquo; said he.</p>

<p>The trump of judgment could scarce have rung with
a more dreadful note in the ears of Pitman and the lawyer.
To Morris this erroneous name seemed a legitimate enough
continuation of the nightmare in which he had so long been
wandering. And when Michael, with his brand-new bushy
whiskers, broke from the grasp of the stranger and turned to
run, and the weird little shaven creature in the low-necked
shirt followed his example with a bird-like screech, and the
stranger (finding the rest of his prey escape him) pounced
with a rude grasp on Morris himself, that gentleman&rsquo;s
frame of mind might be very nearly expressed in the
colloquial phrase: &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have one of the gang,&rdquo; said Gideon Forsyth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; said Morris dully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I will make you understand,&rdquo; returned Gideon
grimly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You will be a good friend to me if you can make me
understand anything,&rdquo; cried Morris, with a sudden energy
of conviction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know you personally, do I?&rdquo; continued
Gideon, examining his unresisting prisoner. &ldquo;Never
mind, I know your friends. They are your friends, are
they not?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page393"></a>393</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You had possibly something to do with a piano?&rdquo;
suggested Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A piano!&rdquo; cried Morris, convulsively clasping Gideon
by the arm. &ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re the other man! Where is it?
Where is the body? And did you cash the draft?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is the body? This is very strange,&rdquo; mused
Gideon. &ldquo;Do you want the body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Want it?&rdquo; cried Morris. &ldquo;My whole fortune depends
upon it! I lost it. Where is it? Take me
to it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, you want it, do you? And the other man,
Dickson&mdash;does he want it?&rdquo; inquired Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you mean by Dickson? O, Michael Finsbury!
Why, of course he does! He lost it too. If he
had it, he&rsquo;d have won the tontine to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael Finsbury! Not the solicitor?&rdquo; cried Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, the solicitor,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;But where is the
body?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that is why he sent the brief! What is Mr.
Finsbury&rsquo;s private address?&rdquo; asked Gideon.</p>

<p>&ldquo;233 King&rsquo;s Road. What brief? Where are you
going? Where is the body?&rdquo; cried Morris, clinging to
Gideon&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have lost it myself,&rdquo; returned Gideon, and ran out
of the station.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XV</h3>

<h5>THE RETURN OF THE GREAT VANCE</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Morris</span> returned from Waterloo in a frame of mind
that baffles description. He was a modest man; he had
never conceived an overweening notion of his own powers;
he knew himself unfit to write a book, turn a table napkin-ring,
entertain a Christmas party with legerdemain&mdash;grapple
(in short) any of those conspicuous accomplishments that
are usually classed under the head of genius. He knew&mdash;he
admitted&mdash;his parts to be pedestrian, but he had considered
them (until quite lately) fully equal to the demands
of life. And to-day he owned himself defeated: life had the
upper hand; if there had been any means of flight or place
to flee to, if the world had been so ordered that a man could
leave it like a place of entertainment, Morris would have
instantly resigned all further claim on its rewards and
pleasures, and, with inexpressible contentment, ceased to
be. As it was, one aim shone before him: he could get
home. Even as the sick dog crawls under the sofa, Morris
could shut the door of John Street and be alone.</p>

<p>The dusk was falling when he drew near this place of
refuge; and the first thing that met his eyes was the
figure of a man upon the step, alternately plucking at the
bell-handle and pounding on the panels. The man had
no hat, his clothes were hideous with filth, he had the air
of a hop-picker. Yet Morris knew him; it was John.</p>

<p>The first impulse of flight was succeeded, in the elder
brother&rsquo;s bosom, by the empty quiescence of despair.
&ldquo;What does it matter now?&rdquo; he thought, and drawing
forth his latch-key ascended the steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page395"></a>395</span></p>

<p>John turned about; his face was ghastly with weariness
and dirt and fury; and as he recognised the head of his
family, he drew in a long rasping breath, and his eyes
glittered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Open that door,&rdquo; he said, standing back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am going to,&rdquo; said Morris, and added mentally,
&ldquo;He looks like murder!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The brothers passed into the hall, the door closed behind
them; and suddenly John seized Morris by the shoulders
and shook him as a terrier shakes a rat. &ldquo;You mangy
little cad,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d serve you right to smash your
skull!&rdquo; And shook him again, so that his teeth rattled
and his head smote upon the wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be violent, Johnny,&rdquo; said Morris. &ldquo;It can&rsquo;t
do any good now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut your mouth,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;your time&rsquo;s come to
listen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He strode into the dining-room, fell into the easy-chair,
and taking off one of his burst walking-shoes, nursed for a
while his foot like one in agony. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m lame for life,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;What is there for dinner?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Johnny,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing? What do you mean by that?&rdquo; inquired
the Great Vance. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t set up your chat to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I mean simply nothing,&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;I have
nothing to eat, and nothing to buy it with. I&rsquo;ve only had
a cup of tea and a sandwich all this day myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Only a sandwich?&rdquo; sneered Vance. &ldquo;I suppose
<i>you</i>&rsquo;re going to complain next. But you had better take
care: I&rsquo;ve had all I mean to take; and I can tell you what
it is, I mean to dine and to dine well. Take your signets
and sell them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t to-day,&rdquo; objected Morris; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m going to dine!&rdquo; cried the younger
brother.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But if it&rsquo;s not possible, Johnny?&rdquo; pleaded the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You nincompoop!&rdquo; cried Vance. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t we house-holders?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page396"></a>396</span>
Don&rsquo;t they know us at that hotel where Uncle
Parker used to come. Be off with you; and if you ain&rsquo;t
back in half an hour, and if the dinner ain&rsquo;t good, first I&rsquo;ll
lick you till you don&rsquo;t want to breathe, and then I&rsquo;ll go
straight to the police and blow the gaff. Do you understand
that, Morris Finsbury? Because if you do, you had better
jump.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The idea smiled even upon the wretched Morris, who
was sick with famine. He sped upon his errand, and
returned to find John still nursing his foot in the arm-chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What would you like to drink, Johnny?&rdquo; he inquired
soothingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fizz,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;Some of the poppy stuff from
the end bin; a bottle of the old port that Michael liked, to
follow; and see and don&rsquo;t shake the port. And look here,
light the fire&mdash;and the gas, and draw down the blinds;
it&rsquo;s cold and it&rsquo;s getting dark. And then you can lay the
cloth. And, I say&mdash;here, you! bring me down some
clothes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The room looked comparatively habitable by the time
the dinner came; and the dinner itself was good: strong
gravy soup, fillets of sole, mutton chops and tomato sauce,
roast beef done rare with roast potatoes, cabinet pudding,
a piece of Chester cheese, and some early celery: a meal
uncompromisingly British, but supporting.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; said John, his nostrils sniffing wide,
surprised by joy into the unwonted formality of grace.
&ldquo;Now I&rsquo;m going to take this chair with my back to the
fire&mdash;there&rsquo;s been a strong frost these two last nights, and
I can&rsquo;t get it out of my bones; the celery will be just the
ticket&mdash;I&rsquo;m going to sit here, and you are going to stand
there, Morris Finsbury, and play butler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Johnny, I&rsquo;m so hungry myself,&rdquo; pleaded Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can have what I leave,&rdquo; said Vance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
just beginning to pay your score, my daisy; I owe you
one-pound-ten; don&rsquo;t you rouse the British lion!&rdquo; There
was something indescribably menacing in the face and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page397"></a>397</span>
voice of the Great Vance as he uttered these words, at
which the soul of Morris withered. &ldquo;There!&rdquo; resumed
the feaster, &ldquo;give us a glass of the fizz to start with. Gravy
soup! And I thought I didn&rsquo;t like gravy soup! Do
you know how I got here?&rdquo; he asked, with another explosion
of wrath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, Johnny; how could I?&rdquo; said the obsequious
Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I walked on my ten toes!&rdquo; cried John; &ldquo;tramped
the whole way from Browndean; and begged! I would
like to see you beg. It&rsquo;s not so easy as you might suppose.
I played it on being a shipwrecked mariner from Blyth;
I don&rsquo;t know where Blyth is, do you? but I thought it
sounded natural. I begged from a little beast of a schoolboy,
and he forked out a bit of twine, and asked me to make
a clove hitch; I did, too, I know I did, but he said it wasn&rsquo;t,
he said it was a granny&rsquo;s knot, and I was a what-d&rsquo;ye-call-&rsquo;em,
and he would give me in charge. Then I begged from
a naval officer&mdash;he never bothered me with knots, but he
only gave me a tract; there&rsquo;s a nice account of the British
navy!&mdash;and then from a widow woman that sold lollipops,
and I got a hunch of bread from her. Another party I fell
in with said you could generally always get bread; and
the thing to do was to break a plate-glass window and get
into gaol; seemed rather a brilliant scheme.&mdash;Pass the
beef.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you stay at Browndean?&rdquo; Morris
ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Skittles!&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;On what? The <i>Pink Un</i>
and a measly religious paper? I had to leave Browndean;
I had to, I tell you. I got tick at a public, and set
up to be the Great Vance; so would you, if you were leading
such a beastly existence! And a card stood me a lot of ale
and stuff, and we got swipey, talking about music-halls
and the piles of tin I got for singing; and then they got me
on to sing &lsquo;Around her splendid form I weaved the magic
circle,&rsquo; and then he said I couldn&rsquo;t be Vance, and I stuck to it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page398"></a>398</span>
like grim death I was. It was rot of me to sing, of course,
but I thought I could brazen it out with a set of yokels.
It settled my hash at the public,&rdquo; said John, with a sigh.
&ldquo;And then the last thing was the carpenter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our landlord?&rdquo; inquired Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the party,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;He came nosing
about the place, and then wanted to know where the water-butt
was, and the bed-clothes. I told him to go to the
devil; so would you too, when there was no possible thing
to say! And then he said I had pawned them, and did I
know it was felony? Then I made a pretty neat stroke. I
remembered he was deaf, and talked a whole lot of rot, very
politely, just so low he couldn&rsquo;t hear a word. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t
hear you,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;I know you don&rsquo;t, my buck, and I
don&rsquo;t mean you to,&rsquo; says I, smiling away like a haberdasher.
&rsquo;I&rsquo;m hard of hearing,&rsquo; he roars. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d be in a pretty hot
corner if you weren&rsquo;t,&rsquo; says I, making signs as if I was
explaining everything. It was tip-top as long as it lasted.
&rsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m deaf, worse luck, but I bet the constable
can hear you.&rsquo; And off he started one way, and I
the other. They got a spirit-lamp and the <i>Pink Un</i>, and
that old religious paper, and another periodical you sent
me. I think you must have been drunk&mdash;it had a name
like one of those spots that Uncle Joseph used to hold
forth at, and it was all full of the most awful swipes about
poetry and the use of the globes. It was the kind of
thing that nobody could read out of a lunatic asylum. The
<i>Ath√¶neum</i>, that was the name! Golly, what a paper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Athen√¶um</i>, you mean,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you call it,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;so as I
don&rsquo;t require to take it in! There, I feel better. Now I&rsquo;m
going to sit by the fire in the easy-chair; pass me the cheese,
and the celery, and the bottle of port&mdash;no, a champagne
glass, it holds more. And now you can pitch in; there&rsquo;s
some of the fish left and a chop, and some fizz. Ah,&rdquo; sighed
the refreshed pedestrian, &ldquo;Michael was right about that
port; there&rsquo;s old and vatted for you! Michael&rsquo;s a man I like;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page399"></a>399</span>
he&rsquo;s clever and reads books, and the <i>Ath√¶neum</i>, and all
that; but he&rsquo;s not dreary to meet, he don&rsquo;t talk <i>Ath√¶neum</i>
like the other parties; why, the most of them would throw
a blight over a skittle alley! Talking of Michael, I ain&rsquo;t
bored myself to put the question, because of course I knew
it from the first. You&rsquo;ve made a hash of it, eh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Michael made a hash of it,&rdquo; said Morris, flushing dark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What have we got to do with that?&rdquo; inquired John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has lost the body, that&rsquo;s what we have to do with
it,&rdquo; cried Morris. &ldquo;He has lost the body, and the death
can&rsquo;t be established.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t want
to?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, we&rsquo;re far past that,&rdquo; said his brother. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
the tontine now, it&rsquo;s the leather business, Johnny; it&rsquo;s the
clothes upon our back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stow the slow music,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;and tell your
story from beginning to end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris did as he was bid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now, what did I tell you?&rdquo; cried the Great
Vance, when the other had done. &ldquo;But I know one
thing: I&rsquo;m not going to be humbugged out of my
property.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should like to know what you mean to do,&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you that,&rdquo; responded John with extreme
decision. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put my interests in the hands of
the smartest lawyer in London; and whether you go to
quod or not is a matter of indifference to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, Johnny, we&rsquo;re in the same boat!&rdquo; expostulated
Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we?&rdquo; cried his brother. &ldquo;I bet we&rsquo;re not!
Have I committed forgery? have I lied about Uncle
Joseph? have I put idiotic advertisements in the comic
papers? have I smashed other people&rsquo;s statues? I like
your cheek, Morris Finsbury. No, I&rsquo;ve let you run my
affairs too long; now they shall go to Michael. I like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page400"></a>400</span>
Michael, anyway; and it&rsquo;s time I understood my situation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment the brethren were interrupted by a
ring at the bell, and Morris, going timorously to the door,
received from the hands of a commissionaire a letter addressed
in the hand of Michael. Its contents ran as
follows:</p>

<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Morris Finsbury</span>, if this should meet the eye of,
he will hear of <span class="sc">Something to his Advantage</span> at my office,
in Chancery Lane, at 10 <span class="sc">A.M.</span> to-morrow.</p>

<p class="sc rt">&ldquo;Michael Finsbury.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pt05">&nbsp;</div>

<p>So utter was Morris&rsquo;s subjection that he did not wait
to be asked, but handed the note to John as soon as he
had glanced at it himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to write a letter,&rdquo; cried John. &ldquo;Nobody
but Michael could have written that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Morris did not even claim the credit of priority.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page401"></a>401</span></p>
<h3>CHAPTER XVI</h3>

<h5>FINAL ADJUSTMENT OF THE LEATHER BUSINESS</h5>

<p class="noind"><span class="sc">Finsbury</span> brothers were ushered, at ten the next
morning, into a large apartment in Michael&rsquo;s office; the
Great Vance, somewhat restored from yesterday&rsquo;s exhaustion,
but with one foot in a slipper; Morris, not positively
damaged, but a man ten years older than he who had left
Bournemouth eight days before, his face ploughed full of
anxious wrinkles, his dark hair liberally grizzled at the
temples.</p>

<p>Three persons were seated at a table to receive them:
Michael in the midst, Gideon Forsyth on his right hand,
on his left an ancient gentleman with spectacles and silver
hair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By Jingo, it&rsquo;s Uncle Joe!&rdquo; cried John.</p>

<p>But Morris approached his uncle with a pale countenance
and glittering eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you did!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You absconded!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-morning, Morris Finsbury,&rdquo; returned Joseph,
with no less asperity; &ldquo;you are looking seriously ill.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No use making trouble now,&rdquo; remarked Michael.
&ldquo;Look the facts in the face. Your uncle, as you see,
was not so much as shaken in the accident; a man of your
humane disposition ought to be delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, if that&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Morris broke forth, &ldquo;how about
the body? You don&rsquo;t mean to insinuate that thing I
schemed and sweated for, and colported with my own hands,
was the body of a total stranger?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page402"></a>402</span></p>

<p>&ldquo;O no, we can&rsquo;t go as far as that,&rdquo; said Michael
soothingly; &ldquo;you may have met him at the club.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris fell into a chair. &ldquo;I would have found it out
if it had come to the house,&rdquo; he complained. &ldquo;And why
didn&rsquo;t it? why did it go to Pitman? what right had
Pitman to open it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you come to that, Morris, what have you done
with the colossal Hercules?&rdquo; asked Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He went through it with the meat-axe,&rdquo; said John.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in spillikins in the back garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s one thing,&rdquo; snapped Morris; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my
uncle again, my fraudulent trustee. He&rsquo;s mine, anyway.
And the tontine too. I claim the tontine; I claim it now.
I believe Uncle Masterman&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must put a stop to this nonsense,&rdquo; said Michael,
&ldquo;and that for ever. You say too near the truth. In one
sense your uncle is dead, and has been so long; but not in
the sense of the tontine, which it is even on the cards he
may yet live to win. Uncle Joseph saw him this morning;
he will tell you he still lives, but his mind is in abeyance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He did not know me,&rdquo; said Joseph; to do him justice,
not without emotion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re out again there, Morris,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;My
eye! what a fool you&rsquo;ve made of yourself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And that was why you wouldn&rsquo;t compromise,&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As for the absurd position in which you and Uncle
Joseph have been making yourselves an exhibition,&rdquo;
resumed Michael, &ldquo;it is more than time it came to an end.
I have prepared a proper discharge in full, which you shall
sign as a preliminary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Morris, &ldquo;and lose my seven thousand
eight hundred pounds, and the leather business, and the
contingent interest, and get nothing? Thank you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like you to feel gratitude, Morris,&rdquo; began Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;O, I know it&rsquo;s no good appealing to you, you sneering
devil!&rdquo; cried Morris. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s a stranger present, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page403"></a>403</span>
can&rsquo;t think why, and I appeal to him. I was robbed of that
money when I was an orphan, a mere child, at a commercial
academy. Since then, I&rsquo;ve never had a wish but to get
back my own. You may hear a lot of stuff about me; and
there&rsquo;s no doubt at times I have been ill advised. But it&rsquo;s
the pathos of my situation; that&rsquo;s what I want to show
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morris,&rdquo; interrupted Michael, &ldquo;I do wish you would
let me add one point, for I think it will affect your judgment.
It&rsquo;s pathetic too&mdash;since that&rsquo;s your taste in literature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; said Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the name of one of the persons who&rsquo;s to
witness your signature, Morris,&rdquo; replied Michael. &ldquo;His
name&rsquo;s Moss, my dear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a long silence. &ldquo;I might have been sure it
was you!&rdquo; cried Morris.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll sign, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; said Michael.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rdquo; cried Morris.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re compounding a felony.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, we won&rsquo;t compound it, Morris,&rdquo;
returned Michael. &ldquo;See how little I understood the
sterling integrity of your character! I thought you would
prefer it so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here, Michael,&rdquo; said John, &ldquo;this is all very fine
and large; but how about me? Morris is gone up, I see
that; but I&rsquo;m not. And I was robbed, too, mind you; and
just as much an orphan, and at the blessed same academy
as himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you&rsquo;d better
leave it to me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m your man,&rdquo; said John. &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t deceive a
poor orphan, I&rsquo;ll take my oath. Morris, you sign that
document, or I&rsquo;ll start in and astonish your weak mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With a sudden alacrity, Morris proffered his willingness.
Clerks were brought in, the discharge was executed, and
there was Joseph a free man once more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Michael, &ldquo;hear what I propose to do.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page404"></a>404</span>
Here, John and Morris, is the leather business made over
to the pair of you in partnership. I have valued it at the
lowest possible figure, Pogram and Jarris&rsquo;s. And here is
a cheque for the balance of your fortune. Now, you see,
Morris, you start fresh from the commercial academy; and,
as you said yourself the leather business was looking up, I
suppose you&rsquo;ll probably marry before long. Here&rsquo;s your
marriage present&mdash;from a Mr. Moss.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Morris bounded on his cheque with a crimsoned countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand the performance,&rdquo; remarked John.
&ldquo;It seems too good to be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply a readjustment,&rdquo; Michael explained. &ldquo;I
take up Uncle Joseph&rsquo;s liabilities; and if he gets the
tontine, it&rsquo;s to be mine; if my father gets it, it&rsquo;s mine
anyway, you see. So that I&rsquo;m rather advantageously
placed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morris, my unconverted friend, you&rsquo;ve got left,&rdquo;
was John&rsquo;s comment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now, Mr. Forsyth,&rdquo; resumed Michael, turning
to his silent guest, &ldquo;here are all the criminals before you,
except Pitman. I really didn&rsquo;t like to interrupt his
scholastic career; but you can have him arrested at the
seminary&mdash;I know his hours. Here we are then; we&rsquo;re
not pretty to look at: what do you propose to do with
us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing in the world, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; returned Gideon.
&ldquo;I seem to understand that this gentleman&rdquo;&mdash;indicating
Morris&mdash;&ldquo;is the <i>fons et origo</i> of the trouble; and, from
what I gather, he has already paid through the nose. And
really, to be quite frank, I do not see who is to gain by any
scandal; not me, at least. And besides, I have to thank
you for that brief.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Michael blushed. &ldquo;It was the least I could do to let
you have some business,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s one thing
more. I don&rsquo;t want you to misjudge poor Pitman, who is
the most harmless being upon earth. I wish you would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page405"></a>405</span>
dine with me to-night, and see the creature on his native
heath&mdash;say at Verrey&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have no engagement, Mr. Finsbury,&rdquo; replied Gideon.
&ldquo;I shall be delighted. But subject to your judgment, can
we do nothing for the man in the cart? I have qualms of
conscience.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing but sympathise,&rdquo; said Michael.</p>
